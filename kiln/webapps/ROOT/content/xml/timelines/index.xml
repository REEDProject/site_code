  <overview>
    <p>REEDâ€™s playhouse timelines provide a new way of navigating
    through our digital playhouse editions. Here, you can explore
    events relevant to each playhouse collection alongside a map of
    locations related to each event. You can also find links that will
    take you to records associated with each event in the timeline. We
    hope that the timelines provide a way of browsing through the
    playhouse collections that is complementary to the Explore
    Collections view. Please see below for a list of currently
    available and forthcoming timelines.</p>
