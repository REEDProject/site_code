                        <p>John of Gaunt's two register books contain various orders, including
                            orders for payments, letters, and many other types of official records
                            concerning the running of the vast duchy of Lancaster. Some of the
                            orders are addressed to borough and other local officials within the
                            duchy, and deal with local arrangements. Two such excerpts deal with
                            Newcastle under Lyme and Tutbury, and hence the register books are fully
                            described above, under those boroughs. The register books also contain a
                            vast amount of material about the running of Gaunt's various households
                            in England, as far-flung as Bamburgh, Leicester, Kenilworth, Kingston
                            Lacy, Hertford, and the Savoy, as well as others in Europe. Records of
                            his payments for minstrels and other entertainers have been transcribed,
                            wherever activities or payments for them may have occurred, because the
                            administrative centres of the duchy appear to have been Tutbury and
                            Kenilworth. The register books have been published as <title>John of

                        <p>This volume contains (a) copies of earlier accounts, beginning in 1519,
                            which are in the same hand as entries for the years 1611 onwards, so
                            they presumably were copied by the town clerk or his scribe; (b)
                            accounts of bailiffs, chamberlains, churchwardens, and schoolwardens,
                            because the accounts of the minor officials were presented and approved
                            by the corporation officials before being entered into the town book. In
                            the transcriptions, the entries from the churchwardens are
                            differentiated from the bailiffs' (later the mayors') accounts because
                            they originated from different authorities. The churchwardens'
                            accounting year was 21 December–20 December, with the accounts presented
                            to the bailiffs between 13 February and 19 March, the Friday following
                            Quadragesima Sunday. The bailiffs' accounting year was 18 October–17
                            October, with the accounts similarly being presented between 13 February
                            and 19 March. The mayoral accounting year was later adjusted slightly to
                            begin the next Monday after St Luke's Day (ie, 27 October).</p>

                        <p>John of Gaunt's two register books contain various orders, including
                            orders for payments, letters, and many other types of official records
                            concerning the running of the vast duchy of Lancaster. Some of the
                            orders are addressed to borough and other local officials within the
                            duchy, and deal with local arrangements. Two such excerpts deal with
                            Newcastle under Lyme and Tutbury, and hence the register books are fully
                            described above, under those boroughs. The register books also contain a
                            vast amount of material about the running of Gaunt's various households
                            in England, as far-flung as Bamburgh, Leicester, Kenilworth, Kingston
                            Lacy, Hertford, and the Savoy, as well as others in Europe. Records of
                            his payments for minstrels and other entertainers have been transcribed,
                            wherever activities or payments for them may have occurred, because the
                            administrative centres of the duchy appear to have been Tutbury and
                            Kenilworth. The register books have been published as <title>John of

                        <p>21 May 1631; English; paper; bifolium used as single sheet for letter written on f [1]; 295mm x 180mm; autograph.</p>
                        <p>These two sets of orders for the minstrels' court contain, in items [a/b] and [c/d], the two variant versions of the orders. It is assumed that [a], the version of the orders which cannot be precisely dated, is earlier because it is a re-issue (with minor changes, errors, and omissions) of the orders of 1618 (TNA: DL 41/587). Presumably the letter of 7 May 1630, [b], was intended to accompany this version of the orders. It could not have been intended for the orders dated later, the revised orders of 10 May 1630 (1631?), item [c]. These revised orders presumably reflect changes ordered by the new chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Edward Barrett, Lord Newburgh, who held office from April 1629 concurrently with his predecessor, Sir Humphrey May, or perhaps by May himself. May's death in June 1630 likely caused some upheaval in the workings of the Chancery office, and may account for the confusion in dates with this version of the orders. In any case there appears to have been a delay of a little over a year before the revised orders, item [c], were issued, along with item [d], Newburgh's letter of 21 May 1631 ordering that the orders be exemplified and enforced. However, the existence of an exemplification dated 10 May 1630 (1631?) may indicate that Newburgh's letter was related to yet another recension of the orders, now lost. The relationships between these variant versions, one concludes, are not at all clear.</p>

                        <p>The MS contains annual churchwardens' accounts, presented usually at Lady
                            Day or Mid-Lent Sunday each year; in most cases the date of presentation
                            specifies the calendar year. This is assumed to have been in Old Style
                            and the year has been corrected accordingly (for example, 1520 has been
                            given as 1520/1). There are several cases in which both the calendar and
                            regnal year are specified; in these the year appears to be given in New
                            Style and has not been corrected. The handwriting, presumably that of
                            the parish clerk, changes several times in the course of the years
                            covered by the document.</p>
