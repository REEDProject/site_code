                <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that
                    is establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of
                    Shakespeare and his contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since
                    then to locate, transcribe, and edit historical documents containing evidence of
                    drama, secular music, and other communal entertainment and ceremony from the
                    Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans closed the London theatres.</p>

            <div xml:id="introduction">
                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>The web application EATS (the entity authority tool set) has been used to 'tag'
                    records with terms of interest to REED users. Each tag can be used to filter
                    search results. Each tag also has its own page, accessed by clicking on a
                    highlighted tag in the records or editorial materials.</p>
                <p>As with REED print indexes, only terms and concepts deemed significant to users
                    have been tagged. This is why not all occupations, for instance, have been
                    tagged.</p>
                <p>At this time, the tagging is not comprehensive. It is, instead, being used as a
                    pointer to get users to the relevant document. A record may include the word
                    'piper' more than once but usually the first instance alone has been tagged;
                    thus, a reader should never assume a tagged word is the only instance of that
                    word or concept in the record. The first-instance rule, however, is not
                    absolute. Additional tags may be used to clarify pronouns or other unclear
                    references.</p>
                <p>Along with record transcriptions, record headings are always tagged as are
                    endnotes (first instance). The document descriptions and Introduction are
                    lightly tagged, with more comprehensive tagging of the Introduction planned for
                    the future. For now, the web browser's search should help find terms of interest
                    in the Introduction. Translations are not tagged.</p>
                <p>Because some tags appear in endnotes, document descriptions, marginalia, or
                    footnotes, they will not be visible without first opening the accordions
                    underneath the record transcription. This is a good place to check if a tag is
                    not immediately apparent within the record transcription itself.</p>
                <p>As the database grows, terms within the filters will multiply, so the current set
                    does not represent a model for the entire REED corpus, only the uploaded
                    collections.</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="terminology">
                <head>Tag Terminology</head>
                <p>Due to the difficulty of classifying musical terms like 'piping,' 'pipe music,'
                    etc, as either entertainers or entertainments, we have classed all such terms as
                    entertainers. Therefore, the tag 'pipers' encompasses all kinds of piping
                    activity, allowing the researcher to search more efficiently. Similarly, records
                    that mention 'music' have been tagged with 'musicians,' and records that mention
                    'dancing' have been tagged with 'dancers.'</p>
                <p>To tag entertainer terms that can mean more than one thing, especially those in
                    Latin, we have relied on the wording of the record rather than editorial
                    judgments. Thus, 'histrio, histrionis' and 'mimus, mimi' are tagged as
                    'entertainers, unspecified.' For more on Latin performance terms and their
                    meanings, see REED's <ref
                        target="http://reed.utoronto.ca/principal-terms-relating-to-performance/"
                        >Anglo-Latin Wordbook</ref>.</p>
                <p>Under the Collectives, Occupation filter, the 'parish clergy' tag includes
                    vicars, rectors, ministers, curates, and parsons; 'cathedral clergy' includes
                    deans and canons; and 'monastic orders' includes abbots, priors, monks, friars,
                    abbesses, and nuns.</p>
                <p>The Record Types filter allows users to refine results by the type of source
                    document. As more collections are added to the database, more varieties will
                    appear within each category. The Central Government and Royal category will
                    eventually include records from the courts of law such as the Assizes, Chancery,
                    Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's/Queen's Bench, and Star Chamber. The Local
                    Government category will include borough records (such as city accounts, court
                    records, minutes, and orders) and county records (such as quarter and petty
                    sessions). The Church category will include diocesan administration (such as
                    ecclesiastical visitations), records of the ecclesiastical courts, and parish
                    accounts. The Family category will include accounts, correspondence, diaries
                    and commonplace books, wills, and inventories.</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="filters">
                <head>How Filters Work</head>
                <p>By default, all records in the database are displayed on the Search the Records
                    page. Filters along the left side of the page can be used to refine the results.
                    See <ref target="/howto/search/">Search Tips</ref> for basic instructions
                    on filters and searching.</p>
                <p>After a term is selected within the filters, the table of results will reload,
                    showing only records tagged with that term. The filters will also reload.
                    Selecting 'Corpus Christi Day' from the Calendar Days, Liturgical filter will
                    find records tagged with the term 'Corpus Christi Day.' Under the Calendar Days,
                    Liturgical filter, other days may still be listed because they appear in records
                    tagged with 'Corpus Christi Day.' Similarly, selecting 'female' under the
                    People, Gender filter will find records containing female named individuals, but
                    the list of named individuals under the People, Named filter will include male
                    and unknown names, as well as female names, because they appear in records with
                    a female individual.</p>
                <p>In most instances, selecting a term from the filters will find records tagged
                    with that term. In the case of four filters, however, the search results will
                    also include records with associated tags: (1) Location (2) Collectives,
                    Occupation, (3) Entertainers, Type, and (4) Drama, Type.</p>
                <p>1) Searching for a location will find not only records tagged with that location,
                    but also any records tagged with places within that location. A search for the
                    county of 'Staffordshire' will also find any settlements or features contained
                    within Staffordshire, even if Staffordshire itself is not tagged in those
                    records.</p>
                <p>2) Searching for 'mayors' under Collectives, Occupation will find not only
                    records with the word 'mayor/s,' but also records with named mayors. A search on
                    any occupation works like this.</p>
                <p>3) Searching for 'players' under Entertainers, Type will find records with
                    generic players, named players, or patronized troupes of players, such as the
                    15th earl of Derby's players. To refine the results and find only patronized
                    troupes who are players, select 'patronized' under Entertainers, Status. A
                    search on any entertainer type works like this.</p>
                <p>4) Searching for 'plays' under Drama, Type will find records with generic plays
                    or titled plays such as 'Hamlet.' To refine the results and find only titled
                    plays, select 'titled' under Drama, Status. A search on any drama type works
                    like this.</p>
