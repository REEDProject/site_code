        <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
          establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
          contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
          and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
          communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
          closed the London theatres.</p>

            <p> By the terms of this assignment, Henslowe assumed the remaining twenty years (ending
              in 1605) of the original lease of the Little Rose to William Griffen. The assignment
              was co-signed by Robert Withens and Peter Blower, as representatives of the parish of
              St Mildred Bread Street, and the scrivener, Thomas Newman. A later lease document

            <p> From the reference here to the 'playe howse now in framinge' it is apparent that the
              playhouse foundations had been started before 10 January 1586/7. It is equally clear
              from the description of the 'smalle ten<ex>emen</ex>te or dwellinge howsse scittuate
              and standinge at the sowthe ende' of the property that John Cholmley already held a
              lease on that tenement, which was to become a potentially lucrative victualling house
              for the playhouse. His small building is shown on John Norden's maps of 1593 and 1600
              in the southwest corner of the Little Rose site. For more on the late
              twentieth-century excavation of the site and Cholmley's house, see Bowsher and Miller,
                <title>Rose and the Globe</title>, pp 24–32, 111.</p>

            <p> Also mentioned in the deed is the builder John Griggs, who was employed again five
              years later in 1592 to renovate and extend the audience capacity of the playhouse.

            <p> At least two of the companies involved in these controversial performances are known
              to have been the queen's men and John Lyly's boy company at Paul's, both of which seem
              to have come to grief as a result of their participation. It is also possible that
              Will Kemp and his company, Lord Strange's men, engaged in satirical stage mockery of
              Martin. Kemp is listed as one of the 'haggling and profane' satirists working to ruin
              Martin in <title>Theses Martinianae</title>, dated 22 July 1589: see further Manley
              and MacLean, <title>Lord Strange's Men </title>, pp 37–41. Although the date of
              arrival of Lord Strange's men for residence at the Rose has not yet been confirmed, it
              seems very likely that they were there by <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1590, as their
              extant petition to the privy council and another by the Thames watermen pleading for
              their continuing use of the Rose indicate (see further 'History of the Rose
              Playhouse'<!-- CB insert cross ref -->). The summer of 1589 remains a possibility for
              their early performances at the Rose therefore. </p>

            <p> The reference to 'this longe vacation' is usually interpreted as the summer months.
              Strange's men are here arguing their case as persuasively as possible, with an evident
              awareness of the economic advantage to be gained from long-term residence at the
              Bankside playhouse, conveniently located for presenting London audiences with a
              repertory of plays that were to be documented in detail by Henslowe when he began the
              'diary' he inherited from his brother in 1591/2. The reference to the concern that
              they be forced to divide and take the traditional summer touring roads instead and
              then as a result be 'vnreadie to serve her ma<ex>ies</ex>tie, when it shall please her
              highenes to com<ex>m</ex>aund vs' suggests that they expected an invitation to perform
              at court, as indeed they did, twice, during the Christmas season, 1590: see further

            <p> The 'tediousnes of the waie' to Newington Butts has been much commented on. The old
              playhouse, dating back to 1576, was about a mile's walk from Bankside and so less
              conveniently placed for London playgoers taking the boat or London Bridge to
              Southwark. The fact that 'of longe tyme plaies haue not there bene vsed on working
              daies' is worth noting. The leaseholder of the Newington property by this time was
              Peter Honningborne, not known as a theatre manager, so Henslowe must have paid for
              temporary use of the playhouse there, as he probably did later in the summer of 1594.
              Whether others paid for occasional use after 1587 when the Rose was opened on Bankside
              remains an open question. </p>

                could taking w<ex>i</ex>th mee on of the Sherifes, whear I found great multitudes of
                people assembled togither, &amp; the principall actours to bee certein servants of
                the ffeltmakers gathered togither out of Barnsey street<note type="foot">Barnsey

                  w<ex>i</ex>th a great number of lose &amp; maisterles men apt for such pourposes.
                Whearupon having made proclamation &amp; dismissed the multitude I apprehended the
                chief doers and authors of the disorder and have co<ex>m</ex>mitted them to prison

                whome ye sayed companies assembled them selves by occasion &amp; pretence of their
                meeting at a play w<ex>hi</ex>ch bysides the breach of ye Sabboth day giveth
                opportunitie of co<ex>m</ex>mitting these &amp; such lyke disorders. The principall
                doers in this rude tumult I mean to punish to the example of others. Whearin also it
                may please yo<ex>u</ex>r L<ex>ordship</ex> to give mee yo<ex>u</ex>r direction, if
                you shall advise vpon any thing meet to bee doon for the farther punishm<ex>en</ex>t
                of the sayed offenders. Hearof I thought good to advertise yo<ex>u</ex>r
                  L<ex>ordship</ex> (w<ex>hi</ex>ch I am infourmed by ye inhabitants of Southwark
                men of best reputation ‸<add place="above">among</add> them) that the Knight
                Mareschalls men in the serving of their warrants, do not vse themselves
                w<ex>i</ex>th that good discretion &amp; moderate vsage as wear meet to bee doon in
                lyke cases but after a most rough &amp; violent manner, provoking men by such hard
                dealings to contend w<ex>i</ex>th them w<ex>hi</ex>ch would otherwise obey in all
                duetifull sort. As I vnderstand they did in this case, whear they entred the house,
                whear the warrant was to bee served w<ex>i</ex>th a dagger drawen affreyting the
                goodwyfe who satt by the fire w<ex>i</ex>th a young infant in hir armes and
                afterwards having taken the prisoners &amp; co<ex>m</ex>mitted them to the
                Mareschalsea (whear they lay 5. dayes w<ex>i</ex>thout making their answear) these
                mutinous persons assembling them selves in this disordered manner the Knight
                Mareschalls men beeing w<ex>i</ex>thin the Mareschalsea, issued foorth w<ex>i</ex>th
                their daggers drawen, &amp; bastianadoes in their hands beating the people (whearof
                soom passed that way by chance, soom cam but to gaze as the manner is) and
                afterwards drew their swords. Whearby the tumult was more incensed &amp; themselves
                endangered but y<ex>a</ex>t help cam to prevent farther mischief. The sayed
                inhabitants of Southwark do farther complain that the sayed Knight Marschalls men
                beehave themselues very vnneyghbourly &amp; disdaynfully among them, refusing to pay
                scot or lot w<ex>i</ex>th them, or any other dueties to Church or co<ex>m</ex>mon
                Wealth w<ex>hi</ex>ch maketh the inhabitants the more to dislyke them. This much I
                thought good to signifie to y<ex>ou</ex>r L<ex>ordship</ex> that (if y<ex>ou</ex>r
                  L<ex>ordship</ex> thinck good) they may bee admonished of their beehaviour, &amp;
                to vse more discretion in serving their warrants: for that such tumults beeing once
                raysed by disordered multitudes ar rather to bee quenched &amp; suppressed by
                policie for the present time, then farther to bee kindled by such violent means. And

            <p> The lord mayor probably now had two theatres to worry about on Bankside, both the
              Rose and Francis Langley's new Swan playhouse in Paris Garden. The mayor had
              previously expressed anxiety about Langley's intention to erect his playhouse in a
              letter to Lord Burghley on 3 November 1594 (LMA: COL/RMD/PA/01/002, ff 33–3v). The
              letter will be included in the forthcoming Swan Playhouse collection in the REED
              series, but for a previous transcription see Chambers and Greg, 'Remembrancia,' pp

            <p> This order was never carried out and may not have been related to the performance of
                <title>The Isle of Dogs</title> during the same summer as some have assumed: see
              William Ingram, 'The Closing of the Theaters in 1597: A Dissenting View,'
                <title>Modern Philology</title> 69.2 (November 1971), 105–15. Glynne Wickham, while
              subscribing to the view that the order should be seen in the context of the
                <title>Isle of Dogs</title> production, has pointed out that the intention of the
              order was essentially a restraint of public performances in London for three months
              only rather than outright suppression of all theatres. In fact, playing resumed at the
              Curtain and the Rose (but not the Swan) in October and November 1597. As he notes, the
              chamberlain's and admiral's men were preparing for performances at Court during the
              Christmas season and both enjoyed the patronage of members of the privy council, so
              rehearsing for a royal audience would have facilitated their return to those two
              public stages in the autumn. See further 'The Privy Council Order of 1597 for the
              Destruction of all London's Theatres,' <title>The Elizabethan Theatre: Papers given at
                the International Conference on Elizabethan Theatre held at the University of
                Waterloo, Ontario, in July 1968</title>, David Galloway (ed) (Toronto, 1969), 21–44.

            <p> In 1589 Francis Langley had acquired the lordship of the manor of Paris Garden, west
              of Bankside in the parish of St Saviour, Southwark. By 1595 he had opened a second
              theatre there, the Swan, which must have increased the traffic of playgoers across the
              Thames to the area (for further details and illustrations, see
              https://reed.library.utoronto.ca/content/swan-theatre). Jacob Meade (1557–1624) was a
              waterman, resident in the Clink liberty and Henslowe's partner in the later Hope/Bear
              Garden enterprise. It seems possible from this entry in the vestry minutes that he may
              have had an association with Henslowe for the Rose as well as the Bear Garden by 1598,
              around the time when he was appointed keeper of the Royal Game of Bears, Bulls and
              Mastiff Dogs (see further Warner, <title>Catalogue</title>, p 234). Meade first
              appears in 1597 as a resident of Rose Alley in the Clink in the St Saviour Token

            <p> Most of the plays named in the inventories appear in Henslowe's diary and have been
              noted from the Foakes edition and, where relevant, the <title>Lost Plays
                Database</title>, Roslyn L. Knutson, David McInnis, and Matthew Steggle (eds),
              https://www.lostplays.org/ <del>accessed <!-- CB to provide date --></del>. For more
              details on each, see Wiggins, <title>British Drama</title>, vols 2–4. Very few of
              those named survive. Wiggins' titles have been followed for each in the textual
              notes.</p>

            <p> Carson, <title>Companion</title>, pp 49–50, notes several puzzles presented by this
              document: 'Not the least of these is the identity of the author. The phrase "I have
              bought" sounds suspiciously like Henslowe, and if indeed he is the compiler of the
              list then the words probably mean no more than "have lent the actors to buy". The fact
              that one of the plays on the list <title>Vayvode</title>, belonged to Edward Alleyn in
              January 1599 raises the possibility that he may have been the "I" in question' (p 49).
              Carson further outlines other anomalies, such as omission on the list of playbooks of
              some plays known from the diary to have been staged or purchased in the same period.
              Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, p 103, favours Henslowe as the compiler
              of the list of plays owned by the company, but with the exclusion of those still owned
              by Alleyn.</p>

            <p> John Pig (Pyg), the boy actor known to have been in the admiral's men, 1597–9, was
              previously with Strange's men (1593): see Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's
              Opposites</title>, pp 284–5, and Edwin Nungezer, <title>A Dictionary of Actors and of
                Other Persons Associated with the Public Representation of Plays in England before
                1642</title> (New Haven and London, 1929), 283. For William Slye (d. 1608), see
              Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 340–1; Greg, <title>Dramatic
                Documents</title>, vol 1, p 50; Gurr, <title>Shakespeare Company</title>, pp 241–2;
              and Nungezer, <title> Dictionary of Actors</title>, p 333. For shorter entries on both
              actors with further bibliographical references, see David Kathman, <title>Biographical

            <p> Forman dates the first entry 4 March 1600 but by 4 March 1600/1 the admiral's men
              had moved from the Rose to the Fortune. Furthermore, the astrological symbol for Mars
              indicates that 4 March fell on a Tuesday, as it did in 1599/1600 but not 1600/1 (with
              thanks to Alan H. Nelson for this note and his revision of the date). Rowse,
                <title>Simon Forman</title>, p 15, dated the entry as 4 March but both Cerasano,
              'Philip Henslowe, Simon Forman,' p 158, and Lupic, 'Early Performances,' p 99, n 5,
              misread the date as 9 March.</p>

            <p> However, as Lupic points out, the entry for 15 March 1599/1600 indicates that
              Cerasano (p 158) misdates Forman's attendance at the performance of <title>Sir John
                Oldcastle</title> in the following comment: 'On 16 October 1600, in the final
              performances of the Lord Admiral's Men at the Rose, Forman attended <title>Sir John
                Oldcastle</title>, although it is unclear whether Forman saw Part 1 or Part 2 of the
              play.' Lupic (p 99) points out that on '12 March Henslowe made a payment to the tailor
              for his work relating to the production of <title>The Second Part of Sir John
                Oldcastle</title>. Four days later Forman saw <title>Sir John Oldcastle</title>, and
              given the closeness of these dates the most plausible interpretation is that the play
              Forman saw was indeed the freshly mounted second part.' In any case Forman's primary
              purpose in noting the performance was to record the address of a woman he was
              interested in pursuing for other
              reasons.<!-- Carolyn to insert acute accent three times over c in

              and https://lostplays.folger.edu/Sir_John_Oldcastle,_Part_2). Wiggins follows Cerasano
              in dating the performance of <title>Sir John Oldcastle</title> as Thursday, 16
              October, and includes the possibility that the play was Part 1 rather than Part 2.

              residents in the neighbourhood on 9 March 1599/1600 (TNA: PC2/25, p 78) but a
              subsequent letter on 8 April to the Middlesex justices of the peace confirms the

            <p> Philip Henslowe's nephew Francis (1566–1606) appears in the St Saviour's Token Books
              as resident along Rose Alley adjacent to the playhouse in 1594 (Ingram and Nelson,
                <title>Token Books</title>, http://tokenbooks.folger.edu). By 1594 Francis had
              joined the queen's men (Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, p xxv and n 2) but in
              1595 he was acting at the Swan near where he had relocated to Langley's 'New Rents' in
              Paris Garden (1595–8). He cannot be tracked in the Token Books in 1603–4 when he shows
              up here associated with the Rose playhouse. See further Mark Eccles, 'Elizabethan
              Actors II: E-J' <title>Notes and Queries</title>, 38.4 (1991), 459; Chambers,
                <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, p 323; Edwin , <title>A Dictionary of
                Actors and of Other Persons Associated with the Public Representation of Plays in
                England before 1642</title> (New Haven and London, 1929), 186–7. Griffin and a
              Thomas White were both listed in the Token Books for 1604 as resident in Horseshoe
              Alley which led down to Maid Lane. Francis Henslowe is not listed as a resident that
              year. </p>

            <p> The 'Late Playhouse' may or may not have been demolished by this time although the
              archaeological evidence suggests that demolition likely happened by 1606. See further
