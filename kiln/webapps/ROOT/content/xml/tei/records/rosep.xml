        <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
          establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
          contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
          and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
          communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
          closed the London theatres.</p>

          <p>The property known as the Little Rose was situated on the south bank of the Thames in
            the liberty of the Clink, located to the west of London Bridge in Southwark and to the
            east of Paris Garden manor.<note type="foot">For manor boundaries and other locations,
              see the linked <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/rosep/"
                >interactive map of London and Southwark</ref>.</note> The bridge was the only
            crossing of the river to link the city of London and lands south and south-east of the
            river from Roman times until the eighteenth century, so its presence there was key to
            the development of Southwark as a zone of hospitality for travellers, notably Chaucer's
            pilgrims to Canterbury.<note type="foot">See further Martha Carlin, <title>Medieval
                Southwark</title> (London, 1996), 191–8. See also Great Britain, J.S. Roskell (ed),
                <title>The House of Commons 1386–1421</title>, vol 1, The History of Parliament
              (Stroud, 1992), 638–9, where medieval Southwark's 'great diversity of crafts and
              industries' (some of them, eg, slaughterhouses and tanning, less salubrious) is also
              noted.</note> The lordship of the manor was acquired by Henry of Blois, bishop of
            Winchester, from the priory of St Saviour, Bermondsey in the twelfth century and the
            area continued to lie outside the jurisdiction of the London city authorities until the
            nineteenth century.<note type="foot"> Bowsher and Miller, <title>Rose and the
                Globe</title>, pp 11–12.</note> At the outset the greater part of the bishop's manor
            comprised marshy fields, meadows, and pastures. At the north-east corner of the estate,
            the bishop and his successors built a palace to serve as their London area residence:
            the fine rose window of the great hall's west end wall remains standing on the south
            side of modern Clink Street as a silent witness to the former grandeur of the episcopal
              palace.<note type="foot"> Martha Carlin's doctoral dissertation includes an extensive
              description of Winchester House; see 'Urban Development,' vol 1, pp 79–119.</note>
            Development of the rest of the estate for urban uses followed gradually, with smaller
            houses and inns built first along the riverside by the road that became known as
            Bankside by the sixteenth century.<note type="foot">For a concise description of the
              medieval area of the Clink and Bankside, see Julian Ayre and Robin Wroe-Brown,
                <title>The London Millennium Bridge: Excavation of the Medieval and Later
                Waterfronts at Peter's Hill, City of London, and Bankside, Southwark</title>, MoLAS
              Archaeology Studies Series 6 (London, 2002), 11–12, 53. Mao, 'Rose Playhouse,'
              provides a more extensive study of the further economic and social development of the
              sixteenth-century Southwark neighbourhood.</note> The brothels or 'stews' of Bankside
            were a notorious attraction there until suppression began in 1506, culminating in Henry
            VIII's royal proclamation against the stews, which legislated their closure on 13 April
              1546.<note type="foot">Society of Antiquaries: Proclamations, vol 2, f 164 (to be
              included in the Bear Garden/Hope playhouse records edited by Stephanie Hovland and
              MacLean, forthcoming in the REED series).</note> Maiden or Maid Lane running parallel
            to the river and south of Bankside was named and known as early as the mid-thirteenth
            century and may indicate that prostitution was already flourishing by then.<note
              type="foot">Maid Lane is now modern Park Street. For the acquisition of the manor, its
              medieval development, and its wider context in the borough of Southwark, see Carlin,
                <title>Medieval Southwark</title>, pp 32–51. Carlin's work for her PhD dissertation
              (see 'Urban Development') also remains an important source for the history of the
              area.</note></p>

          <p>The property called the Rose stretched from Bankside to Maid Lane and was owned by
            William Spence, a fishmonger of London, in the early years of the sixteenth
              century.<note type="foot">In June 1537 Spence, then of Great Palgrave, Norfolk, but
              previously citizen and stockfishmonger of London, sold the Great Rose to Henry
              Polsted: for the deed, see TNA: E 326/12364.</note> By this time the Little Rose had
            been segregated from the 'Great Rose' so its subsequent history evolves under different
            ownership. However, the deed drawn up for Spence's sale of the Great Rose names a Ralph
            Symonds as the resident of the tenement and garden just east of the Great Rose. This
            refers to the smaller section of the Little Rose which fronted on the Thames; the larger
            garden of the property extended from behind the Hartshorn Inn to Maid Lane.<note
              type="foot">See the map and Carlin, 'Urban Development,' vol 1, pp 67–8.</note> An
            alley that became known as Rose Alley ran between these two sections of the Little Rose
            property but not all the way to Maid Lane until later in the seventeenth century.<note
              type="foot">Bowsher and Miller, <title>Rose and the Globe</title>, pp 24, 79.</note>
            Near the north-west edge of the Little Rose boundary lay two properties owned by the
            bishops of Winchester called the Barge (on the east) and the Bell and Cock (on the
            west). The Bell and Cock in particular was destined to feature in the history of
            bearbaiting on Bankside by the mid-sixteenth century.</p>
          <p>After Ralph Symonds' death in 1541, his widow, Thomasyn, inherited the Little
              Rose.<note type="foot">Ralph Symonds' will (TNA: PROB 11/29/32) was made on 8
              September 1541 and proved 1 February 1541/2: see Alfred Beaven, <title>The Aldermen of
                the City of London Temp. Henry III-1912</title>, vol 2 (London, 1908), 26.</note> By
            1552 she determined to make a charitable bequest of the Little Rose property in
            perpetuity following her death. Income from its rents would contribute to support of the
            poor from her parish, St Mildred’s Bread Street London, and from Christ's Hospital, as
            well as needy fishermen in Old Fish Street. The deed, dated 3 December 1552, names as
            feoffees two gentlemen from Kent as well as sixteen others, very likely from St
            Mildred's parish. From her death in 1555 onward, the trust seems to have been managed by
            representatives from the parish. The description of the estate in the deed indicates
            that some urban development had occurred: 'all that my mesuage or ten<ex>emen</ex>t
            called the little Roose with two gardeyns to the same adioyning sett lying &amp; being
            in the p<ex>ar</ex>ish late called seynt margarett<ex>es</ex> in Southwark in the County

              Chancery Close Roll C54/482, mb 13, now at The National Archives. The details are
              discussed by Bowsher and Miller, <title>Rose and the Globe</title>, pp 23–4. Thomasyn
              Symonds' will was drawn up on 17 September 1551 but not probated until 8 May 1555 (see
              TNA: PROB 11/37/319, transcribed by William Ingram in Appendix 1@xc/#CB to link
              RSTSLR@xc \).</note> The mention of 'pond<ex>es</ex>' suggests that, like the
            neighbouring pike gardens to the west, the Little Rose still had some fishponds at the
            time. The marshy land along Bankside had been used in recent centuries for breeding
            freshwater fish, especially pike, in ponds maintained by London fishmongers like Ralph
            Symonds.</p>
          <p>On 20 November 1574 six of eight named parishioners of St Mildred's Bread Street signed
            a thirty-one year lease for the Little Rose 'messuage or Tenement' with William Griffin
            , a vintner of London. An annual rent of £7 would be due quarterly, with Griffin (or his
            sub-tenants) responsible for repairs and maintenance of the property.<note type="foot"
              >For a transcript of the lease (DC: Mun 8), see Appendix 1@xc\#CB to link RSLNDG@xc
              \.</note> Five years later, on 11 December 1579, Griffin assigned the lease to a
            fellow London vintner, Robert Withens, for a total of £105, transferring the right to
            collect rents from the sub-tenants for the remaining twenty-six years of the property
              lease.<note type="foot">For a transcript of the lease (DC: Mun 10) see Appendix
              1(@xc\CB to link RSWGRW@xc \).</note></p>
          <p>By this time there were several pictorial representations of Bankside and its terrain.
            The earliest plan of Southwark, drawn <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1542, focused on the
            Borough High Street rather than the area running west from London Bridge.<note
              type="foot"> TNA: MPC 1/64. Martha Carlin includes a redrawn version in
                <title>Medieval Southwark</title>, p 39, fig 9.</note> However, there is a view of
            the south bank of the Thames from the city of London's perspective in a mid-eighteenth
            century copy made of a mural, subsequently lost, of the 1547 coronation progress of
            Edward VI through the city.<note type="foot">The Coronation Procession of King Edward VI

              Hieronymous Grimm was made from a mural at Cowdray House destroyed in a fire in 1793.
              For a reproduction see Bowsher and Miller, <title>Rose and the Globe</title>, p 11,
              fig 6.</note> Looking across the river, the church of St Saviour can be seen to the
            right of the bridge and then a shallow line of small houses along Bankside, with a dense
            avenue of trees and the foothills of the North Downs beyond.</p>
          <p>Early modern mapping of London was sporadic, mostly derivative, and pictorial – not
            true cartography until 1676.<note type="foot">The first true cartography was done by
              John Ogilby and William Morgan. For a full view see 'Ogilby and Morgan's Large Scale
              Map of the City As Rebuilt By 1676,' in <title><ref

                  1676)</ref></title>.</note> One of the most often used views is the so-called Agas
            woodcut map published in 1633 but really based on a finer copperplate map produced <hi
              rend="italic">c</hi> 1560, of which only three sections remain extant for
              comparison.<note type="foot">For a full digital reproduction of the Agas map (from the
              London Metropolitan Archives print collection), with gazetteer and other features, see
                  <title><ref target="https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/agas.htm">The Map of Early Modern
                  London</ref></title>. For the Copperplate map, see Ann Saunders and John Schofield
              (eds), <title>Tudor London: A Map and a View</title>, London Topographical Society
              Publication 159 (London, 2001).</note> Sadly, none show Southwark. The Agas version of
            the south bank to the east of Lambeth Marsh depicts the string of houses along the edge
            of the river, labelled ‘The Banck,’ with gardens stretching behind. Just a sampling of
            the more extensive fish ponds, or 'pike gardens,' south of the bank is represented and
            there are no theatres in view, a sure clue that the Agas map was based on an earlier,
            pre-1576 version of London. However, by the mid-sixteenth century there is documentary
            evidence to support the existence of bearbaiting arenas in Southwark and these are
            suggested in the two circular arenas just south of the bank, one titled 'The bolle
            bayting' and the other, to the east, 'The Bearebayting.' We should assume considerable
            artistic licence here. The precise locations of the arenas remain in question, but the
            views available suggest that when Withens took over the lease, the Little Rose estate
            consisted of very few buildings along the river with two as yet undeveloped 'gardens'
            stretching behind.</p>
          <p>Just over six years later Robert Withens sold the remainder of the Little Rose lease to
            Philip Henslowe, by then a resident of Bankside.<note type="foot">Henslowe first appears
              in the <ref target="http://tokenbooks.folger.edu">St Saviour's Token Books</ref> in
              1588 as a parishioner living at the east end of Bankside 'from the Bell.'</note> The
            terms of the lease, signed by both parties on 24 March 1584/5, remained the same as
            previously, with no indication of the sale price.<note type="foot">See <ptr
                target="#rosep-ridm90656952"/>.</note></p>
          <p>The next document of interest relating to the Little Rose has deeper significance for
            the history of London theatre. On 10 January 1586/7 Henslowe signed a deed of
            partnership with a London grocer, John Cholmley.<note type="foot">See <ptr
                target="#rosep-ridm90584488"/>.</note> Their joint venture was, in fact, the first
            playhouse to be built in Southwark, on the Little Rose property recently leased by
            Henslowe. The basic dimensions of the property are described as approximately
            ninety-four feet square. By the time the deed was being drawn up, the playhouse was 'now
            in framinge and shortly to be ereckted.' It seems likely that Henslowe, an entrepreneur
            just beginning to make his mark in Southwark, conceived of the plan and made a start to
            raise a playhouse, with the help of John Griggs the carpenter, in an area more readily
            accessible to London audiences than the earlier playhouse at Newington, about a mile
            from the river, south of Southwark.<note type="foot">For a full-length study of the

                Butts</title>, Routledge Studies in Shakespeare 24 (New York and London,
              2018).</note> However, there was a small house or tenement at the south-west end of
            the property by Maid Lane that already had a tenant, whether resident or not.<note
              type="foot">The Token Books surviving sporadically between 1571 and 1588 do not list a
              John Cholmley (or variant surname) as a Southwark resident.</note> Although the terms
            of the sub-lease for this tenement have not been discovered, the deed of partnership
            makes clear that John Cholmley was the tenant and therefore an agreement of some sort
            with him would probably have been required in order to build the playhouse adjacent on
            the garden plot.</p>
          <p>The partnership agreed to between Henslowe and his tenant Cholmley was potentially
            profitable for both. As Bowsher and Cerasano summarize the terms, 'Cholmley was to pay
            Henslowe £816 in instalments over the course of eight and a quarter years but not
            starting until 25 June [sic, for 24 June], the feast day of St John the Baptist. This
            clearly shows that Henslowe had enough ready money to finance the bulk of construction
            costs himself. In return, Cholmley would receive a half-share in the profits of the
            plays, and have exclusive right to the catering and victualling of the enterprise run
            from his house. Moreover, both men would be allowed to admit their friends to
            performances without charging admission fees. Henslowe would finance the construction of
            the playhouse and pay all rents as of 29 September 1587, suggesting that this was the
            target date for the Rose’s opening. According to the deed, although Cholmley and
            Henslowe would share maintenance expenses of the playhouse thereafter, and throughout
            the period covered by the agreement, Henslowe appears to have financed all of the major
            expenses before the playhouse was operable.'<note type="foot"> Julian Bowsher and S.P.
              Cerasano, <ref target="http://www.henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/essays/rosecontract.html">'The Deed of Partnership in the Rose Playhouse (January 10, 1587),'</ref>

          </p>
          <p>The partnership would expire on Lady Day, 25 March 1595, but after the agreement early
            in 1587 Cholmley virtually disappears from the record. The only other mentions of
            Cholmley amongst the Henslowe-Alleyn papers after 1587 are a couple of scribbles,
            perhaps pen trials, on f 1 of Henslowe’s diary. William Ingram has persuasively
            identified this shadowy character as John Cholmley, originally from Blechingley, Surrey,
            where he began his career as a tanner, following his father's trade, before achieving
            the freedom of the city as a member of the Grocers' Company.<note type="foot">'John

              45–50.</note> This Cholmley died a mere two years into the contract, in April 1589, so
            Henslowe would have assumed the profits from the joint enterprise thenceforth, according
            to the terms of the partnership agreement.<note type="foot"> Cholmley was buried at

            the sewers. The marshy land along the river had required such drainage ditches since the
            thirteeenth century at least and their maintenance was a particular concern of the
            commissioners appointed to ensure that owners carried out their responsibilities or paid

          <p>Henslowe would continue to pay his annual rent of £7 to the feoffees of the Thomasyn
            Symonds trust until the end of the thirty-one-year term. His playhouse had flourished
            for more than a decade but by 1600 the resident lord admiral's men would relocate to the
            new Fortune playhouse built by Henslowe with his partner and son-in-law Edward Alleyn
            north of the city wall in Finsbury. Further, both men desired royal appointment as
            masters of the bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs to complement acquisition of the Bear
            Garden at the nearby Bell and Cock site in 1594.<note type="foot">See DC: MS VIII, f 5v,

              otherwise. There is no reason to identify him with the king’s player, Thomas Pope, who
              died in the same year (TNA: PROB 10/224). Rutter notes that the Rose was not among the
              three playhouses allowed to reopen in April 1604: see her transcription of the privy
              council's 9 April 1604 letter, <title>Documents of the Rose</title>, pp 116–17.</note>
          </p>
          <p>The lease of the Little Rose was soon to come due for renewal in 1605 but the new terms
            increasing the annual rent to £20 with a further 100 marks (equivalent to almost £66)
            required for building repairs were obviously unappealing. It seems most likely that
            Henslowe followed through on his threat to abandon the playhouse. Closure of the
            theatres during the plague year of 1603 and subsequently for periods during 1604 and
            1605 may have further contributed to his decision.<note type="foot">See further F.P.

          <p>The Rose holds a unique place in the history of Elizabethan theatre. It was the first
            of several playhouses built on Bankside. It is the only one to have a contemporary
            record of the repertory of plays performed there as well as the owner’s share of the
            gate, thanks to Henslowe's diary. And it was the first theatre site to be discovered and
            partially excavated in the late twentieth century.</p>

          <p>Admittedly, the diary does not have a complete and readily understood accounting of the
            full run of plays performed and profits taken throughout the almost twenty years of
            theatrical activity at the Rose.<note type="foot">See Carson, <title>Companion</title>,
              p 8 and his summary (p 13) after a detailed analysis of the diary: 'It is difficult to
              imagine how Henslowe could have supervised his various business enterprises without a
              fuller set of books including, at the very least, a ledger in which he would have
              recorded his transactions with individuals. If such books existed, possibly they
              became separated from the diary at the time of Henslowe's death. Whatever the truth,
              we must recognize, I think, that the diary contains only a partial record of
              Henslowe's activities, albeit a record maintained by a reasonably painstaking
              individual.' See also Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, pp 28–30, on the
              'huge gaps in the evidence it supplies us with' (28).</note> Henslowe's earliest
            entries follow his acquisition of the manuscript after his brother John's death in 1591
            so details are lacking for the period before 19 February 1591/2.<note type="foot">Susan

            record, however informal, of his playhouse business between the opening of the Rose in
            1587 and February 1591/2, but that record has not survived so we must piece together
            from various sources what evidence is available centuries later.</p>

            The process and costs are therefore lost to us but between December 1988 and
            May/June 1989, the exciting discovery of the foundations of the Rose revealed unexpected
            details about the architectural design and stage of the first playhouse erected on the
            site 400 years earlier. The story of this discovery has been documented fully by others,
            notably the archaeologists involved: Blatherwick and Pickard, 'Little Rose Estate,'

            of the building and renovation of the Rose, to which the reader is referred.</p>
          <p>In very brief summary, the developer group Imry Merchant acquired the site, intending
            to demolish the existing 1957 office block named Southbridge House before erecting a new
            building now known as Rose Court. A short-term, ten-week archaeological assessment and
            excavation was required by the Southwark Council before construction could commence and
            was funded by the developer. However, ten weeks rapidly turned into six months, as
            Blatherwick and Pickard explain: 'The totality of the survival of those remains plus the
            unprecedented public response towards the extant structure, associated with both William
            Shakespeare and the development of modern English dramatic tradition, had a major impact
            on national policy towards archaeological remains in England and on public awareness of
            the potential of urban archaeological remains. After negotiations in the late spring of
            1989, most of the archaeological remains of The Rose were preserved <hi rend="italic">in
              situ</hi> by the introduction of a protective "environmental" regime and the re-design
            of the piling configuration on which the new development was to sit.'<note type="foot"

          <p>Only two-thirds of the site could be excavated at the time, so the eastern side of the
            playhouse remains to discover. What has been uncovered reveals that the original
            structure was a thatched timber-framed polygon consisting of fourteen sides
            approximately 72' in diameter. There were two rings of walls surrounding an open yard,
            with no reliable proof of the exact location of the exterior entrance into the yard,
            although evidence suggests that it would have been at the south end near the main access
            to the site across the bridge over the sewer at Maid Lane.<note type="foot">See Bowsher
              and Miller, <title>Rose and the Globe</title>, pp 111, 114. It may also be indicative
              that the entrance door to the playhouse is shown at the south end on both versions of
              John Norden's map (1593 and 1600, see p 7 below).</note> The stage, tapered in shape,
            projected out into the north section of the yard between bays 6 and 10, delimited by the
            inner wall at the north. Bowsher summarizes its measurements –which surprised many
            scholars at the time – as follows: 'At the front it had three edges, a long central one
            and two tapering shorter sides. It thus had a depth of 5m (16ft 5in.) and an estimated
            maximum width of 11.5m (36ft 9in.) narrowing to 8.2m (26ft 10in.) at the front, covering
            an area of about 46.4m (499.45sq ft).... The wooden boards of the actual stage would
            certainly have been raised above the level of the yard, perhaps by 1.52m (5ft) as
            recorded at the Red Lion. The front stage wall at the Rose survives to a height of about
            0.12m (4 3/4in.) above the yard but flush with the surface under the stage. It was
            therefore a permanent feature, unlike the temporary trestles employed at the later
              Hope....'<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose Theatre</title>, 39–40. Given the
              fixed stage, Bowsher, in a later essay, refutes the speculation that the Rose might
              have been first intended to serve as a bearbaiting arena before serving as a
              playhouse, an idea floated by Jon Greenfield and Andrew Gurr in 'The Rose Theatre,
              London: The State of Knowledge and What We Still Need to Know,'
                <title>Antiquity</title> 78 (June 2004), 330–40. See further Bowsher, 'The Rose and
              its Stages,' <title>Shakespeare Survey</title> 60 (2007), 36–48.</note> There was no
            evidence of supporting pillar bases for a roof overhanging the stage or a projecting
            tiring house: the area between the outer and inner back walls of the stage likely served
            the latter purpose.<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose Theatre</title>, p 69, n 11,

            wooden boards, raised well above the yard surface. Within the footprint of the stage was
            a plaster surface that would suggest that there was an under stage area or void, which
            might have provided storage room and access on to the stage proper through a
              trapdoor.'<note type="foot">'Encounters Between Actors, Audience and Archaeologists at

          <p>According to Bowsher, the open yard, of friable grey mortar, where the groundlings
            stood, would have measured approximately 117.3m (1262.62 square feet), 'some 15m (49ft 2
            1/2in.) from east to west and from the stage, 9m (29ft 6in.) from north to south.'<note

              4, 'Staging at the Rose and the Fortune,' 120–61, for an account of the original
              building and renovations of the Rose as well as a consideration of its staging
              conditions compared with the later Fortune playhouse where the building contract
              provides details that we can only wish we had for the upper structure of the
              Rose.</note> The northern section of the yard had a notable slope, raked to the front
            of the stage. No evidence of an exterior stair tower, interior staircase, or the number
            of galleries was discovered, though either two or three galleries seem likely.</p>
          <p>This building, as partially revealed at its foundation level by archaeologists in 1989,
            was the Rose, built by the carpenter John Griggs in partnership with Philip Henslowe and
            opened by October 1587. At the end of that month the neighbours were complaining to the
            authorities that the privy council order restraining plays on the Sabbath was being
            ignored in the liberty of the Clink.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92853384"/>.</note> 
            A previous letter on 7 May 1587 from the privy council to the Surrey justices
            of the peace, ordering the inhibition of plays during the heat of the summer months,
            might imply the opening of the Rose sooner than has been assumed, but the letter is not
            specific enough to confirm an earlier date of opening.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92788552"/>.</note></p>
          <p>There is no direct documentary evidence known about the company or companies first
            hired to play at the Rose. A common assumption has been that Lord Strange's men arrived
            there just as Henslowe began using his famous memorandum book. Furthermore, the
            speculative dating of 1592 or 1593 has been typically assigned to the petition from
            Strange's men to the privy council and the watermen's companion petition to the lord
            admiral pleading for the reopening of the Rose, as well as the privy council's response
            in lifting the restraint on playing there.<note type="foot"> For associated records, see: <ptr target="#rosep-ridm90916024"/>, <ptr target="#rosep-ridm90877112"/>, and <ptr target="#rosep-ridm90700072"/>.</note> 
            See, for example, Chambers, <title>Elizabethan
              Stage</title>, vol 4, p 311, who suggests a date of July 1592 following the restraint
            of playing at the Rose from 23 June 1592 after the Feltmakers' apprentices' recent riot
            in Southwark. However, Alan H. Nelson has studied the seventeen signatures on the
            watermen’s petition, discovering from his St Saviour's parish register research that two
            of those signing were dead by 1591.<note type="foot">Nelson has not yet published his
              2012 conference paper, ‘Philip Henslowe and the Bankside Watermen: A Fresh Look at
              Three Familiar Documents’ (paper, University of Reading, November 24, 2012). For now,
              see further Manley and MacLean, <title>Lord Strange’s Men</title>, pp 50–1.</note>
            Given that the earliest of the two men's death dates was January 1590/1, the previous
            summer of 1590 therefore becomes a viable date for the petitions and, just possibly, the
            year before.</p>

          <p>Strange's men were a large company performing plays by some of the best in the business
            – Marlowe, Kyd, and Greene among others, and quite likely including a young Shakespeare
            by 1592.<note type="foot">For an in-depth study of the first known company resident at
              the Rose, see Manley and MacLean, <title>Lord Strange's Men</title>. Unless otherwise
              noted, discussion of their career at the Rose comes from this source. </note> When
            Henslowe was forced to close the playhouse temporarily <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1590,
            for as yet unknown reasons, they protested <quote source="#rosep-ridm90916024">‘oure Companie is greate, and thearbie
              o<ex>u</ex>r chardge intollerable, in travellinge the Countrie, and the Contynuaunce

              shall please her highenes to com<ex>m</ex>aund vs.’</quote> 
            So too did the self-described ‘poore watermen,' who benefitted from
            ferrying the constant traffic across the Thames to the theatre. The reference to the
            players' hope of a command performance before the queen is worth remarking on. Some of
            the most seasoned actors of the day had joined Lord Strange's men following the death of
            their previous patron, the earl of Leicester, in September 1588.<note type="foot">For
              details of Leicester's men and the formation of their new company, see <title>Lord
                Strange's Men</title>, pp 30–6.</note> During the Christmas and Shrovetide seasons,
            1590–90/1, they were to perform twice at court, so their anticipation of such a
            lucrative opportunity, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1590, was not unfounded. As noted in the
            previous section, Edward Alleyn, the star actor from lord admiral's men, would join them
            soon, possibly as early as these first court performances, so they must have rapidly
            become a major attraction on Bankside. The following year they were invited to perform
            an unprecedented six plays at court during the festive season, so it is likely that they
            would have continued to prefer residency at the Rose the rest of the year rather than
            touring the provinces.</p>

          <p>At some point during 1591–2, Henslowe renovated his playhouse, perhaps in response to
            the remarkable success of the resident acting company. Early in his diary, ff 4–5v, he
            notes, in itemized detail, 'such carges as I haue layd owt a bowte my playe howsse in
            the year of or lord 1592.'<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>,
              pp 9–13, and the Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project, MSS 7, ff: <ref target=" https://www.henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/images/MSS-7/004r.html">4r-5v</ref>.</note> The costs were considerable, totalling around £108.<note type="foot">Carson,
                <title>Companion</title>, pp 14–15.</note> The 1989 archaeological excavation of the
            site revealed some of these structural renovations made to the playhouse with the
            assistance of the original builder, John Griggs. The alterations were focused on
            rebuilding the northern end of the site to allow for an increase in audience capacity
            and improved staging conditions. The stage was newly constructed: as Bowsher describes,
            it was '...built 2.1m (6ft 10 1/2in.) farther north than the original. It had a depth of
            5.6m (18ft 4in.) and it is estimated to have been 8.4m (27ft 7in.) long, although its
            front length was not fully uncovered by our excavation. This would have provided a
            complete stage area of about 50.5m2 (543.58sq ft).... Although its dimensions were not
            much larger than those of the first stage, it was slightly more rectangular and gave the
            impression of a greater "thrust" because of the extension of the yard on each side of
              it.'<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose Theatre</title>, pp 48–50.</note> Surviving
            evidence of pillars close to the front corners of the stage suggests that a roof for
            full stage cover was provided for the first time, thereby necessitating the widening
            outward of the galleries to the east and west to preserve sight lines. The yard was thus
            substantially expanded by an estimated thirty-nine per cent 'to cover about 163m2 (1754
            1/2sq ft).<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose Theatre</title>, p 51.</note> It was
            barely raked, in contrast to the incline of the first, and the original mortar was
            replaced with a mix of compacted earth, cinder, and cracked hazelnut shells.<note

            diary indicate the addition of a 'penthowwse shed' added at the tiring house door behind
            the stage, but no trace was found of its construction or precise site during the
            excavation. He also refers for the first time to a lords' room and its ceiling but the

          <p>As the diary confirms, in 1592–3 Lord Strange's men performed at Henslowe's Rose, with
            an extended run from 19 February–22 June 1592, and another from 29 December 1592–1
            February 1592/3. It seems improbable that they would have mounted their plays during the
            period of reconstruction of the north end of the playhouse, so the February/March 1591/2
            dates of Henslowe's 'carges' would seem to favour Neil Carson's assessment that 'The
            receipts are for large bills which were probably presented some months after the work
            was completed. The other expenses listed on folios 4–5 have the appearance of an account

              that builders' wages and construction costs would have been paid in arrears if their
              work preceded the performance season.</note></p>

          <p>During the spring and early summer of 1592, the company played 'an initial series of
            105 consecutive performances of twenty-four different plays, old and new, and then a
            shorter series of twenty-nine performances, including three more new plays, for a total

          <p>External events, however, would disrupt the continuous operation of the Rose in the
            early 1590s. The first followed the performance of <title>A Knack to Know a
              Knave</title> on 22 June. On 23 June the privy council ordered the closure of
            playhouses in London and the suburbs until Michaelmas, out of concern for the potential
            of further unrest and disorder at Midsummer that might be triggered by London
            apprentices.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92855896"/>.</note> This order was
            clearly in response to the mayor of London's letter of 12 June outlining <quote source="#rosep-ridm93270024">'moste
              outrageous and tumultuous'</quote> events that had happened recently when Feltmakers’
            apprentices clashed with the knight marshals’ men in Southwark.
            Although the play that served as the context for the assembly of Feltmakers’ apprentices in Southwark was not named, the Rose would have been
            the only playhouse available for a performance there. However reluctant they may have
            been, this very large and successful company of Strange's men was therefore forced to
            tour the provinces, with some of their performance stops on record, starting with an
            appearance at Rye in Sussex on 24 June.<note type="foot">For details of their summer and

          <p>The second season in repertory at the Rose began soon after the first of six
            performances at court on 27 December. Between 29 December and 1 February 1592/3
            Strange's men were back in residence but a serious outbreak of plague led to another
            privy council order on 28 January for closure of all London area theatres for the
            duration of 1593.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92826968"/>.</note> Strange's men
            would never return to the Rose and Henslowe does not record performances and profits
            taken again until 27 December 1593 when he itemizes the appearances of the earl of
            Sussex's men for several weeks until 6 February1593/4.<note type="foot">See Foakes,

            Thirty performances were offered, with a total of thirteen plays in repertory.<note type="foot"
              >Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 92–6, and Gurr,
                <title>Shakespearian Companies</title>, pp 174–7, 182–4, both provide concise
              summaries of the career and repertory of this company. Both sources give a starting
              date of 26 December and a count of twelve plays during Sussex's first run at the Rose,
              but a check of the diary corrects that reckoning.</note> The inclusion of <title>Titus
              Andronicus</title>, presumed to belong to Pembroke's men, and Strange's <title>The Jew
              of Malta</title> in their schedule has led some scholars to deduce that Sussex's
            company now included some actors from Pembroke's men and others from the remnants of the
            earl of Derby's men. Henry Radcliffe, the earl of Sussex, died on 14 December 1593 just
            before his company began playing at the Rose so they would have been in transition
            during the early part of 1594. Lord Strange became the 5th earl upon his father's death
            on 25 September 1593. By late 1593 Ferdinando Stanley, the new earl of Derby, had lost
            favour at court and his company probably had to seek patronage elsewhere. When the key
            players resumed activities in mid-1594 they were re-formed as the Lord Chamberlain’s
            men, soon to include both Richard Burbage and Shakespeare in their ranks, but at a
            different theatre. Where they were during the first half of the year remains a mystery
            but the title page of <title>Titus Andronicus</title>, entered in the Stationers'
            Register on 6 February 1593/4, may hold a clue to temporary amalgamation of some of the
            actors from each company in the attribution 'Plaide by the Right Honourable the Earle of
            Derbie, Earle of Pembrooke, and Earle of Sussex their Seruants.'<note type="foot">See

          <p>Another break in the performance schedule resulted from the privy council's order
            addressed to the lord mayor on 6 February 1593/4. An open-ended restraint of plays was
            imposed again for fear of plague: <quote source="#rosep-ridm93271400">'Wee thearfore thought it very expedient to require
              yo<ex>u</ex>r L<ex>ordship</ex> foorthw<ex>i</ex>th to take strait order that thear

            that the Rose was forced to close again, not to reopen for business until 1–8 April when
            the diary notes eight performances of five plays there by Sussex's and the queen's men
            together.<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, p 21, available on the <ref target="https://www.henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/images/MSS-7/009r.html">Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</ref>.</note>
             Added to the repertory were two well-known queen's men plays, <title>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</title> and 
            <title>King Leir</title>, both performed twice.</p>
          <p>During this period of plague and uncertainty for acting companies and playhouse owners,
            Edward Alleyn seems to have returned to his former mates in the lord admiral’s men. No
            surprise, perhaps, that Henslowe's son-in-law and partner Alleyn, who was also the lead
            actor of the company, would accept Henslowe's offer to make their base at the Rose.
            Between 14 May 1594 and 13 July 1600 the lord admiral's men began a long-term engagement
            at the Rose that was broken only by periodic interventions by the privy council when
            plague fears resurfaced, by required closures during Lent, or by very occasional
            disruptive events.<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, pp

            limited tours in the provinces but their preference was clearly for London and the court
            where they were invited to perform annually fourteen times before 1600 (with the sole
            exception of 1596–7).<note type="foot">For performances at court, see Gurr, 'Appendix
              4,' <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, p 293.</note></p>

          <p>Gurr has proposed that in May 1594 Henry Carey, the lord chamberlain of the royal
            household, with his son-in-law, Charles Howard, the lord admiral, established a
            'duopoly' of officially sanctioned acting troupes under their patronage that would
            henceforth dominate the London theatre scene while also satisfying the need to provide
            the queen with court entertainment during the Christmas and Shrovetide festive
              season.<note type="foot">Gurr assumes the establishment of a duopoly in many of his
              publications. For a summary of the proposal see his article, 'Henry Carey's Peculiar
              Letter,' <title>Shakespeare Quarterly</title> 56 (2005), 51–75, and
                <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, pp 2–6. Gurr's 'Appendix 3,' p 290, also
                lists the admiral's men touring dates, 1594–1600, but see further REED, <ref target="https://reed.library.utoronto.ca"><title>Patrons
                  and Performances</title></ref>, for fuller details of
              their touring career and provincial performance venues during their years in primary
              residence at the Rose.</note> Engaging in current debates about this admittedly
            speculative proposal seems unnecessary within the focused context of this collection.
            However, a healthy skepticism seems in order, given the lack of documentary evidence.
            There is sufficient resistance to regulation by authorities on record to suggest that
            the explosion of creative talent and the drive for commercial success in London, and by
            extension, at court, in the entertainment business during this era might have challenged
            such an attempt to restrict playing in the London area to only two companies at only two
              playhouses.<note type="foot">Holger Schott Syme lays out some of the challenges to the
              duopoly proposal in 'The Meaning of Success: Stories of 1594 and Its Aftermath,'

          <p>The first interruption in the new arrangement between Henslowe and the re-formed lord
            admiral's men seems to have occurred between 17 May and 14 June. From 3–13 June both the
            lord admiral's men and the recently formed lord chamberlain's men moved to the old
            playhouse at Newington Butts, less conveniently located a mile to the south and soon to
            be closed. Laurie Johnson has recently done an in-depth study of this relatively unknown
            and little documented playhouse and its brief glory days when two famous Elizabethan
            companies brought their talents to its stage. He proposes that extreme weather and
            flooding on the marshy Bankside during the 1594 'year of floods' must have caused
            Henslowe's move to negotiate rental of an alternative space with the Newington Butts
            owner, Peter Hunningborne: 'I suggest the ongoing rain and spates of high waters took
            their toll on Henslowe's Bankside venue, forcing him to consider viable alternatives,
            and Newington's indoor venue on high ground would seem to have been just that.'<note

              further pp 136–7 and 140–5. MacLean's small edition of dramatic records for Newington
              Butts will be forthcoming in the REED series.</note> Whether the two companies
            performed the seven plays mounted there together (some more than once) or alternated
            remains the subject of ongoing debate as Henslowe groups his entries together under a
            common heading and the exact number and membership of the companies during this era of
            formation are not known.<note type="foot">See, for example, Greg, <title>Diary</title>,
              vol 2, pt 2 pp 85–6, and more recently, Johnson, <title>Shakespeare's Lost

              28.</note></p>

          <p>When the lord admiral's men returned to the Rose on 15 June, they settled in for a long
            residency, their almost daily performances for the following year disrupted only by
            performances at court on 28 December and 1 and 6 January.<note type="foot">They ended
              their first run on 26 June 1595: see Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, p 30.
              For a succinct chart of performance dates and related payments for the Rose,
              1594–1600, the 'Chronological Abstract of the Diary in so far as it Relates to
              Dramatic Affairs' provided by Greg, <title>Diary</title>, vol 2, pp 328–32, remains
              useful and is not repeated here. Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp
              141–3, 159–60, also summarizes the dates of opening and closing at the Rose, as
              witnessed, not always consistently, by Henslowe.</note> In fact, Henslowe's accounting
            practices between 15 June 1594 and 5 November 1597 allow a relatively reliable view of
            the repertory schedule at the Rose before he shifts to a notably different style of
            record. Gurr has traced the membership, performances, repertory practices, and play
            texts during the company's sojourn at the Rose in detail in his study of the company in
              <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, to which the reader is referred. Earlier
            studies of the company and its career at the Rose include Chambers' summary in
              <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 139–73, and Greg's earlier edition of
              <title>Henslowe's Diary</title> with extensive commentary and tables of reference in
            volume 2.</p>

          <p>Gurr accounts for 158 plays performed by or written for the lord admiral's men as
            recorded in Henslowe's diary or in the Stationers' Register up to the summer of 1600. Of
            this remarkable repertory only twenty-four have survived in print and two in
              manuscript.<note type="foot">See Gurr, 'Appendix 1,' <title>Shakespeare's
                Opposites</title>, pp 201–53. Others have published their own inventories of plays
              performed at the Rose, with predictable variations in the titles included and the
              interpretation of the diary's records. See, for example, Chambers, <title>Elizabethan
                Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 143–7, 165–71; Rhodes, 'Appendix A,' <title>Henslowe’s
                Rose</title>, pp 185–223; and Scott McMillin who narrows his focus to published and
              manuscript plays that can be securely identified with the Rose, <title>The Elizabethan
                Theatre and </title>
              <title>The Book of Sir Thomas More</title> (Ithaca and London, 1987), 115–24.</note>
            For this same period, he includes the following 'plots' that may have belonged
            originally to the lord admiral's men but are now gathered in BL: Add MS 10449, ff 2, 3,
            and 5: <title>Frederick and Basilea</title>, from a lost play they first performed in
            1597; the fragmentary <title>Troilus and Cressida</title> from a lost play written by
            Dekker and Chettle in 1599 and presumably performed soon thereafter; and Peele's
              <title>The Battle of Alcazar</title>, which Greg has argued persuasively for dating as
            1598. Greg published transcriptions of all three, with commentary, in <title>Henslowe
              Papers</title>, pp 135–44.<note type="foot">See Foakes, 'Appendix 3,'
                <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, pp 326–33, for the actors named in all six extant

              transcription, <title>Henslowe Papers</title>, pp 129–32.</note> The roll call of
            playwrights working with lord admiral's men during their Rose period includes, among
            others, Thomas Heywood, Anthony Munday, Thomas Dekker, George Chapman, George Peele,
            Michael Drayton, Henry Chettle, and Ben Jonson, with older plays of proven popularity
            from the late Christopher Marlowe (<title>Jew of Malta</title>, <title>Massacre at
              Paris</title>, 1 and 2 <title>Tamburlaine</title> and <title>Doctor Faustus</title>)
            and Thomas Kyd (<title>Spanish Tragedy</title>) still in the repertory.</p>
          <p>In 1595, the Rose was closed for most of Lent, but this was also when Henslowe recorded
            his costs for renovations to the playhouse that were largely cosmetic, for painting and
            carpentry. In June the same year he also paid for making a throne for the
              'heavens.'<note type="foot">See Bowsher and Miller, <title>Rose and the Globe</title>,

            competition was surfacing on Bankside at this time. Francis Langley, who had acquired
            the manor of Paris Garden in 1589, was a dodgy customer of less evident management
            abilities than Henslowe but by 1595 he may have been inspired by the Rose’s success to
            open another playhouse, named the Swan. The lord mayor of London wrote in some agitation
            to Lord Burghley on 3 November 1594 about Langley's intentions but it seems likely that
            the Swan opened nonetheless during the following year.<note type="foot">The mayor's
              letter is preserved in the city's Remembrancia (LMA: COL/RMD/PA/01/002, ff 33–3v). For
              a transcription see Chambers and Greg, 'Remembrancia,' pp 74–6.</note> It is possible
            that Henslowe's renovations the same year may have been in response.</p>

          <p>Norden’s 1600 inset map of the city of London (see above) gives a view of the Swan
            playhouse added to the Southwark landscape, west from Bankside in the manor of Paris
            Garden on a corner south from the river. Certainly a Dutch visitor, Johannes de Witt,
            writing to his friend, Arend van Buchell, from London, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1596,
            was much impressed by the new rival south of the Thames:</p>

          <p>'Of all the theatres, however, the largest and most distinguished is the one whose sign
            is a swan (commonly, the Swan theatre), which, to be sure, accommodates three thousand
            people in seats. [It is] built of an accumulation of flint stones (of which in Britain
            there is a vast abundance) supported by wooden columns which, on account of the colour
            of marble painted on them, can deceive even the most acute, whose form, at least, since
            it [the playhouse] seems to represent the general notion of Roman work, I have drawn
              above.'<note type="foot">This translation from the original copy of the letter made by
              van Buchell in his commonplace book is quoted from Wickham <hi rend="italic">et
                al</hi>, <title>English Professional Theatre</title>, p 441; a transcript of the
              letter will be included in my edition of Swan Playhouse records forthcoming in the
              REED series. Van Buchell's rather amateur copy of the drawing accompanying this letter
              has been much reproduced and used as an example of stage design in the period. See,

          <p>Both the Swan and the Rose would have felt the impact of the privy council's letter to
            the Surrey JPs on 22 July 1596 when plays were prohibited once again for fear of the
            increase in sickness.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92864504"/>.</note> After the
            heat of the summer season had passed, Henslowe's accounting of receipts resumes on 27

            as the lord admiral's men were performing <title>The Witch of Islington</title>, the
            privy council was issuing a stern order to close all playhouses within a three mile
            radius of London until All Hallowtide and further, to <quote source="#rosep-ridm91627064">'plucke down quite the Stages,

          <p>In fact, playing resumed at the Rose (but not the Swan) on 11 October 1597. As Wickham
            notes, the lord admiral’s men would have been preparing for performances at court during
            the Christmas season, and as they enjoyed the patronage of an influential member of the
            privy council, the need to rehearse well in advance would have facilitated their return
            to the stage in the autumn.<note type="foot">Wickham, 'Privy Council Order,' pp

              the lord admiral's men for three years beginning 26 November 1596. See further 'Edward

            three years to pursue other purposes.<note type="foot">See further Susan Cerasano,

          <p>In July 1598, a further, apparently futile, appeal to the privy council was made by
            members of the St Saviour's vestry, requesting that the local playhouses be pulled down
            because of their 'enormyties.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm96581496"/>.</note>
            Instead, a third playhouse would be erected on Bankside the following year when the
            Globe opened on the south side of Maid Lane, not far from the Rose. This playhouse, too,
            is shown on Norden's 1600 inset map. Much has been made in times past of the competition
            that would thereby ensue between the lord admiral's men and the chamberlain's men newly
            relocated from the Theatre to the Globe in 1599. Did Henslowe respond by laying plans to
            move his enterprise in retreat to the north of the city where the Fortune playhouse
            would open in the autumn of 1600? Roslyn Knutson has argued persuasively against a
            narrative inherited from Chambers that when Henslowe changed his style of accounting
            towards the end of 1597 to record more loans to the company and partial payments to
            playwrights it must mean that the lord admiral's men fell on hard times and 'lived from
            hand to mouth, and had acquired the thriftless habit of sharing their profits weekly or
            even daily, and keeping no reserve fund.'<note type="foot">See 'The Commercial
              Significance of the Payments for Playtexts in Henslowe's Diary, 1597–1603,'

                <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 1, p 361, and vol 2, p 162, for the
              unjustified depiction of the playwrights as 'extremely out-at-elbows men of letters
              who hung about the Rose' and 'occasionally found it profitable to take their "earnest"
              for a play, and then to find plausible reasons for indefinitely delaying its
              completion.'</note> Instead, when focusing on the 'crucial year' of 1599–1600, 'which
            has the highest incidence of partial payments in the diary,' Knutson does a close
            analysis of the accounts and concludes as follows: 'I suggest that over the years of
            1597–1603 the Admiral's men maintained a large repertory of new and old plays on a
            variety of popular subjects and in a variety of dramatic kinds; that in 1599–1600 they
            increased the number of works-in-progress that they usually financed in order to acquire
            an even larger, newer, and more diversified set of offerings; that in 1600–1, they eased
            the burden of expenses by continuing plays already in repertory and by reviving a few
            old favorities; that in 1601–2 they increased the number of revivals, which not only
            were relatively inexpensive to produce but also served as a showcase for Alleyn's return
            to the stage.'<note type="foot">Knutson, ‘Commercial Significance,’ p 131. An earlier
              article by Neil Carson, 'Production Finance at the Rose Theatre, 1596–98,'
                <title>Theatre Research International</title> 4 (1979), 172–83, also questioned the
              dominant narrative, pointing out through close analysis of various sources of evidence
              between 1596–8 that the diary does not consistently record all expenses and income and
              so cannot be relied upon as a comprehensive witness to playhouse
            operations.</note></p>
          <p>The probability that Henslowe and Alleyn together had conceived of a strategic move to
            the north before the Theatre was dismantled and the Globe opened on Bankside has been
            discussed in the previous chapter, where links to the relevant records in this
            collection can be found. The January 1599/1600 warrant from the lord admiral in support
            of the new playhouse, in particular, refers to <quote source="#rosep-ridm90723048">'the dangerous decaye of that Howse'</quote>
            (that is, the Rose). Whether these words are an accurate reflection of the Rose's condition or simply designed to
            make a persuasive case for the move of the lord admiral's men to the desired new
            location could be debated. However, the privy council picked up the theme in support of
            Alleyn's building project in their 8 April order, followed by an order on 22 June
            legislating only two playhouses for operation in the London area ¬– the Fortune on the
            north and the Globe on the south. Burbage's Theatre had already been pulled down but the
            venerable Curtain remained, so it was singled out for demolition (which did not
            happen).<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm90676968"/> and <ptr target="#rosep-ridm91010728"/>.</note>
             About eighteen months later, a renewed attempt by the privy council to control the number of
            active playhouses was made and their frustration is apparent:</p>
          <p><quote source="#rosep-ridm91581784">' ... wee do now vnderstande that our said order hath bin so farr from taking dew
            effect, as in steede of restrainte and redresse of the former disorders the multitude of

          </p>

          <p>It is evident that despite the notional 'decay' of the Rose and official attempts to
            reduce the number of playhouses on Bankside, Henslowe continued to maintain its
            operation regardless of the loss of the lord admiral's men to the fair new Fortune that
            he and Alleyn had opened in 1600. The diary's accounts during this period are quite
            sporadic for the Rose and there is no consistent evidence of residency by a single
            company. On a new folio Henslowe begins to record performances by Pembroke's men, but
            only two entries are made for 28–9 October.<note type="foot">See Foakes,

            Henry Herbert, died less than three months later, on 19 January 1600/1, so the company
            probably disbanded shortly thereafter. The only company known to have used the Rose
            subsequently as their base, for almost a year, was the earl of Worcester's men, recorded
            in the diary for various loans, play commissions, and costume purchases for the period

          <p>1603 was a year of national crisis. The aging queen's illness raised anxieties early in
            the year. The privy council's order on 18 March for the restraint of stage plays on 19
            March until further notice was probably in response.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92828856"/>. See also Leeds Barroll, <title>Politics, Plague, and Shakespeare's

            died a week later and was buried on 28 April so playing may have been suspended in
            deference until after that date. Henslowe noted the suspension of play (again) on 5 May
            1603 at the time of King James’ arrival.<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe’s

          </p>
          <p>Other historical sources indicate that the plague raging in London would have kept the
            playhouses closed until after Lent 1604, and even then the rest of that year was likely
            to have been disrupted by fresh outbreaks.<note type="foot">The original privy council
              registers for 1601/2–13 were destroyed by fire in 1618. However, Barroll,
                <title>Politics, Plague, and Shakespeare’s Theater</title>, pp 104–23, provides a
              detailed outline from other historic sources of the likely impact of the 1603–4 plague
              on Shakespeare's company, the king's men, then resident at the Globe, but all London
              area playhouses would have felt the economic consequences.</note> Therefore we might
            ask whether operations ceased at the Rose entirely by May 1603, given the onset of
            plague in London, Henslowe's other involvements at the Fortune and the Bear Garden, as
            well as practical concerns for the age and looming cost of improving and maintaining the
            Rose playhouse as of Michaelmas 1605 when the original lease on the Little Rose would
            expire. As outlined in the first section above, the Sewer Commission reports for 1605–6
            indicate that Henslowe abandoned the lease and the playhouse; the archaeological
            analysis of the remains in 1989 appear to confirm that it was dismantled around the same
              time.<note type="foot">Bowsher and Miller, <title>Rose and the Globe</title>, pp

          <p>Philip Henslowe, who purchased the lease of the Little Rose property from Robert
            Withens in 1584/5, was one of the more remarkable individuals active in the
            entertainment business during the Elizabethan and early Jacobean era. Despite his
            innovative role in developing not only the Rose, but also the later Fortune playhouse in
            Finsbury north of the river and the Hope on Bankside, his reputation suffered many
            slights and misrepresentations from Victorian and twentieth-century commentators. A
            recent and influential example refers to him as ‘an unscrupulous mismanager’; a much
            older one depicts him as ‘an illiterate moneyed man … who regarded art as a subject for
              exploitation.'<note type="foot">Gurr, comparing Henslowe to Christopher Beeston,
                <title>Shakespearean Stage</title>, p 58, and, Frederick Gard Fleay, <title>A

            Fortunately it is no longer necessary to rehabilitate Henslowe's character and
            substantial contribution to the business of playing in early modern London. R.A. Foakes,
            in the most recent edition of <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, shed a clarifying light
            on Henslowe's character as revealed in that most famous record of his numerous and
            varied activities.<note type="foot">Foakes and Rickert collaborated on the first edition
              of <title>Henslowe’s Diary</title> (1961). Foakes published a second edition of the
                <title>Diary</title> in 2002, still a widely available standard reference work and
              therefore not duplicated in this collection. The MS originally belonged to Philip
              Henslowe’s brother John, who used the leaves now at the end (ff 237v–137v) to record
              mining accounts (1577–8) for the Ashdown Forest area in Sussex near the Henslowe

          <p>What has been best known about Henslowe is thanks to the remarkable survival of the
            commonly termed 'diary' – really a memorandum book in which he made rough jottings about
            the theatre business (mainly 1591/2–1604), including playhouse repairs, income from play
            performances, loans to actors and playwrights; his pawn business (1593–6); and other
            miscellaneous entries relating, for example, to property purchases in Sussex, home
            remedies, and aphorisms.<note type="foot">See Susan Cerasano, 'Henslowe's "Curious"
              Diary,' <title>Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England</title> 17 (2005), 72–85,
              where she makes a persuasive argument in favour of 'taking instead a more "holistic"
              approach to Henslowe's book, examining it as an artifact made up of all its many
              parts, that stands within a well-established tradition of memorandum books or, perhaps
              more properly, manuscript notebooks of its time' (p 73). See also Carson,
                <title>Companion</title>, pp 1–13.</note> But Henslowe’s name surfaces in many other
            kinds of documents from the period – personal letters, property leases, court cases,
            contracts, royal appointments, even parish vestry minute books – because he became
            notably active in parish affairs at the church of St Saviour, now Southwark Cathedral,
            by 1608.<note type="foot">See further the <ref target="#background-henslowe-status">section

          <p>The treasure trove of personal papers belonging to Edward Alleyn, actor and founder of
            Dulwich College, includes important documents relating to Henslowe, his father-in-law,
            that remain preserved in the college archives. Many of these have been professionally
            photographed and made available through Grace Ioppolo's open access
              <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title> website , to which this collection
            is much indebted and linked wherever relevant. The evolution of Henslowe as an
            entrepreneur – really the dominant entrepreneur – in the development of substantial
            landholdings along the south bank of the Thames can therefore be traced through the
            archives at Dulwich College and The National Archives in Kew. There, many court records
            of the Chancery and Exchequer reveal more about his lucrative Bankside estates, which
            became the focus of lengthy acrimonious disputes following his death in 1616.</p>

          <p>Philip Henslowe came from a prosperous gentry family with some social status in the
            county of Sussex. He was the fourth of seven children born to Edmond Henslowe (or
            Hensley) and Margaret Ridge, who resided near Lindfield, Sussex.<note type="foot">A
              succinct account of Henslowe's life has been provided by Susan Cerasano for the

            as master of the game in neighbouring Ashdown Forest and Broil Park, so from the start,
            Philip had solid local foundations and a family court connection to build upon.<note

                England</title> 13 (2001), 82–92.</note> Henslowe's exact birth date has not yet
            been confirmed but has been tentatively placed <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1555. He seems
            likely to have moved to the London area in the 1570s, where he surfaces as an apprentice
            to Harry Woodward, a member of the Dyers' Company.<note type="foot">Dyers' Company
              records were lost in the Great Fire so details of the apprenticeship and the
              activities of Woodward himself cannot be traced.</note> It is possible that this was
            the Henry Woodward recorded in 1572 as resident of the Clink in the St Saviour's Token
            Books but where Henslowe lived in the 1570s remains unknown.<note type="foot">See <ref

                The Token Books of St Saviour Southwark</ref>.</note> Certainly Harry Woodward's
            burial was entered in St Saviour's parish register on 8 December 1578, and not long
            after, his widow 'Annys Woodward' married Henslowe on 14 February 1578/9.<note
              type="foot">LMA: P92/SAV/3001.</note> Agnes' two daughters, Joan and Elizabeth,
            thereby became Henslowe's step-daughters but the couple did not have any children of
            their own. Joan's eventual marriage to Edward Alleyn, the star of the lord admiral's
            men, would bring a deep and lasting personal and professional relationship for both men
            that would impact the Elizabethan theatre industry profoundly.</p>

          <p>Although Henslowe retained his identity as a member of the Dyers’ Company, his business
            interests ranged much more widely than the textile industry. Records are scanty for his
            activities until he commenced his acquisition of property on Bankside with the purchase
            of the lease for the Little Rose in 1584/5.<note type="foot">See <ref
                target="#background-property">History of the Rose Property</ref>.</note> From that
            purchase onward, Henslowe's strategic path to success in business, property development,
            and court appointments, as well as his rising social status in the parish of St
            Saviour's Southwark, is fascinating to trace.</p>

          <p>The purchase of the Little Rose lease was surely not a random choice. As the map of
            Southwark shows at a glance, the Little Rose property, adjacent on its west side to the
            Great Rose, was also only a few steps from the Bear Garden flourishing then at the Bell
            and Cock site, a little further west of the Great Rose. Documentary evidence from the
            mid-sixteenth century confirms that bearbaiting was likely the earliest form of popular
            entertainment on Bankside, apart from the notorious brothels that had lined the south
            bank of the river since at least the fourteenth century.<note type="foot">See further
              Carlin, 'Urban Development,' vol 2, pp 478–509.</note> In fact, a
            seventy-seven-year-old witness named John Taylor in a 1620 court case recalled that
            there had been four bearbaiting arenas at various locations in Southwark over the course
            of decades.<note type="foot">Court of Exchequer Case: Attorney General v. William
              Henslowe and Jacob Meade, TNA: E134/18Jas1/Mich10, Item 5. A full transcription of
              this case is forthcoming in the Bear Garden/Hope digital edition in the REED series,
              Stephanie Hovland and MacLean (eds).</note></p>

          <p>Some may have railed against bearbaitings at the time but, in the early 1580s, that was
            the main game on the south bank and likely a lucrative one too. Much of the audience may
            have come across the river by ferry or on foot but there was also a long string of inns
            along the high street of Southwark leading to London Bridge, including the famous Tabard
            where Chaucer’s pilgrims gathered before their trek to Canterbury. When Henslowe
            arrived, the area was therefore already established for rough sports with audience
            appeal, but there was no playhouse yet. The only playhouse south of the river was much
            further south, at Newington Butts, by then no longer under the management of the actor
            Jerome Savage, and less conveniently located. The Theatre and the Curtain were the only
            other playhouses open at this time but they were across the river, north of the city
            walls. Did Henslowe, a man with enterpreneurial instincts and considerable ambition, see
            an opportunity to expand the entertainment options on Bankside by building the first
            Southwark playhouse on the Little Rose site? The evidence suggests that he did.</p>

          <p>When Henslowe purchased the lease of the Little Rose, there no longer seems doubt that
            he had money of his own to invest but his marriage to Harry Woodward's widow must have
            consolidated his financial position further. Judging by the terms of the lease, there
            were already houses and shops on the property, so he could count on steady income from
            rentals for at least twenty more years, when the lease had to be renewed.<note
              type="foot"><ptr target="#rosep-ridm90656952"/>.</note> But he may have had more on
            his mind than rental income.</p>

          <p>Within a short space of time, he must have hired the carpenter, John Griggs, to begin
            building a playhouse: by January 1586/7, less than two years after the lease was signed,
            the deed of partnership with John Cholmley mentions the 'playe howse now in
              framinge.'<note type="foot">For the deed of partnership see <ptr
                target="#rosep-ridm90584488"/>. Mary Edmond, 'The Builder of the Rose Theatre,'
                <title>Theatre Notebook</title> 44.2 (1990), 50–4, provides further biographical
              information on John Griggs, Henslowe's builder and friend.</note> The partnership deed
            itself secured the details of Cholmley's involvement in running concessions for the Rose
            while also avoiding conflict over the location of the playhouse near the small house at
            the Little Rose, for which he probably held an ongoing sub-lease. It is evident,
            however, that it was Henslowe's initial investment that launched the development of the
            Rose.</p>

          <p>The exact opening date of the Rose is not recorded but it is generally agreed to have
            been in operation by October 1587, when some of the local residents had apparently
            complained of the new arrival on the Bankside scene. A letter from the privy council to
            the Surrey justices of the peace on 29 October 1587 outlines the protest as follows:</p>

          <p><quote source="#rosep-ridm92853384">'thinhabitaunts of Southwa<damage><gap unit="chars"
                  extent="2"/></damage> had complained vnto their L<ex>ordshipes</ex> declaring that

              especiallie w<ex>i</ex>thin the libertie of the Clincke and in the p<ex>ar</ex>ish of
              St Sauours in Southwarke.'</quote> There can be no doubt that the plays were performed
            at the Rose, the only playhouse located in the Clink at that time. In fact, more than a
            decade would follow before the Globe opened there on the south side of Maid Lane.</p>

          <p>With the opening of the Rose in 1587, Henslowe launched his role as a playhouse
            landlord in earnest. Sometime between 1587 and 1590 he attracted an acting troupe of
            notable talent to make the Rose their preferred base of operations. We can now say with
            some confidence that this company, Lord Strange’s men, did not aim to pursue the
            provincial touring habits of their predecessors. Presumably they recognized the
            potential of the burgeoning entertainment market of London, even as Henslowe did, so
            finding a stable base for performance at the Rose would have been appealing.</p>
          <p>Sometime during this same period Henslowe began expanding his network in various
            directions. By <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1590, he had gained his first appointment at
            court. The watermen's petition to the lord admiral is the first surviving record to
            refer to him as 'one of the groomes of her ma<ex>ies</ex>ties Chamber'.<note type="foot"
              >For more detail on this and other court appointments throughout Henslowe's life, see
              Cerasano, 'Elizabethan Court,' p 50.</note> Around this time he also met and
            established an increasingly close relationship with Edward Alleyn, the leading actor of
            the lord admiral's men. The precise date when Alleyn left that company to combine forces
            with Strange's men has not been established but sometime in the 1590–1 period is very
            plausible. The touring licence during the plague year issued to Strange's men by the
            privy council on 6 May 1593 includes Alleyn, still named as 's<ex>er</ex>uaunt to the
            right honorable the L<ex>ord</ex> highe Admiral,' but it also refers to the troupe as
            'al one companie s<ex>er</ex>uant<ex>es</ex> to o<ex>u</ex>r verie good the
            L<ex>or</ex>d the L<ex>or</ex>d [sic] Strainge.'<note type="foot">TNA: PC2/20, f 351.
              See Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, p 123.</note> Apparently Alleyn
            retained his individual affiliation with his influential patron, the lord admiral, but
            at some point moved to join Strange's men at the Rose. In October 1592 he married
            Henslowe's step-daughter, Joan, so the personal bonds were strong from at least that
            year forward if not before.</p>
          <p>An intriguing confusion in court records of payment for performances during the 1590/1
            Christmas and Shrovetide seasons may be evidence of an even earlier association of
            Alleyn with Henslowe and Strange's men. The treasurer of the chamber accounts record
            payment on 7 March 1590/1 to the actor George Attwell, on behalf of Strange's men, for
            two performances by his company on 27 December 1590 and 16 February 1590/1.<note

              Malone Society (Oxford, 1962 for 1961), 27.</note> Yet puzzlingly, the privy council,
            on a separate occasion on 5 March 1590/1, authorized warrants for payment instead to
            lord admiral's men for the performances on those same dates.<note type="foot">See Great

            Which record is correct? In his article 'The Chimera of Amalgamation,' Andrew Gurr has
            suggested that this was not an instance of a fleeting amalgamation of the two
              companies.<note type="foot"><title>Theatre Research International</title> 18.2 (1993),
              85–93.</note> Rather, because Charles Howard, the lord admiral, was present at the 5
            March privy council meeting, the official record made at the time acknowledged Alleyn's
            primary affiliation, in deference, though he was performing on both occasions with
            Strange's men. In any case, Alleyn was to become Henslowe's key professional partner in
            several entertainment ventures and they were to prosper together for many years on
            Bankside and beyond.</p>
          <p>The history of the Rose playhouse itself will be outlined in the next section of this
            introduction. Following his older brother John's death in 1591, Henslowe inherited the
            memorandum book where John had earlier recorded some of his Sussex mining accounts
              (1576–81).<note type="foot">See Cerasano, 'Henslowe's Biography,' pp 67–8, and Foakes,
                <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, pp xix-xxiv.</note> By 19 February 1591/2, he began
            to add notes of his own so a more detailed picture of theatrical performances and
            further renovations of the playhouse emerges, thanks to its survival – unique for the
            era. But Henslowe did not rest with managing this innovative venture. Rather, he moved
            ahead with what looks like a strategic plan to acquire more lands on Bankside as well as
            a monopoly on the lucrative bearbaiting enterprise. In December 1594 Edward Alleyn
            bought the lease of the Bear Garden properties at the Bell and Cock from Thomas Burnaby
            – that purchase included an arena, bear house, bull house, cottage, stable, and hayloft.
            He also was licensed as a deputy by Ralph Bowes, then the court-appointed master of the
            bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs, to hold games on the site, with obvious profits to be
            made from paying customers.<note type="foot">See Alleyn's Memorandum Book, DC: MS VIII,
              f 5v, where he notes the cost of the Bear Garden lease as £200: Foakes,
                <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, p 301, and <ref

                Digitisation Project</ref>. The licence cost a further £250. When Alleyn sold his
              stake to Henslowe in February 1610/11, he calculated his annual profit from the
              venture at £60 per annum for a total of £960. Quoted by Greg, <title>Henslowe
                Papers</title>, p 107.</note> Half the interest in this bearbaiting enterprise and

              1622). The records of the case will be published in the Bear Garden/Hope edition in
              the REED series.</note> In 1596 Henslowe added to his growing land holdings by
            acquiring the sub-lease, ultimately from the Crown, for substantially more of Bankside –
            the Unicorn, the Great Rose, and the Queen’s Pike Garden.<note type="foot">Details of

              documents at Dulwich College.</note>
          </p>
          <p>With the consolidation of property along Bankside, Henslowe and Alleyn began developing
            a joint venture for acquiring monopoly of the bearbaiting games there, including the
            court appointment as master of the bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs. The master had a
            number of privileges beyond the lustre of the court appointment. There was a reward each
            time a baiting was held at one of the royal palaces such as Whitehall – and the queen,
            nobility, and foreign visitors did delight in this type of entertainment. The master
            also had sole right to license the many touring bearwards on the provincial circuits,
            while also receiving a percentage of their profits. And then there were the profits from
            the Bear Garden itself, as well as from the breeding and sale of mastiffs.<note
              type="foot">See further Cerasano, 'Master of the Bears,' pp 195–209.</note> There were
            expenses too, of course, but there is no doubt that Henslowe and Alleyn were aiming for
            the appointment soon after the acquisition of the Bear Garden lease at the Bell and
            Cock. Letters indicating that they held this ambition survive from 1598, the year when
            the master, Ralph Bowes, sickened and died. On 4 June, Henslowe wrote to Alleyn as
            follows:</p>

          <p>Very disappointingly, as Henslowe had suspected, John Dorrington, the gentleman

          <p>The mention in the letter of 'ower other matter betwext vs' is intriguing. By 1598
            Alleyn had taken his leave of the stage and would not return until the opening of a new
            playhouse in 1600 to be occupied by the lord admiral's men – the Fortune, located on
            Whitecross Street in the parish of St Giles without Cripplegate just north of the city
            walls. Both Victor Landro and Susan Cerasano have persuasively argued that this move was
            at the planning stage for the two partners during Alleyn's brief retirement and predated
            Alleyn's acquisition of the lease for the site in December 1599.<note type="foot">For
              details of the lease see Greg, <title>Henslowe Papers</title>, p 108, and Chambers,

              North: Playhouse Management in Renaissance London,' <title>Theatre Survey</title> 38.2
              (1997), 37–8.</note> Furthermore, this alternative timeline challenges a traditional
            narrative that the lord admiral's men were forced to abandon the Rose because of
            competition from the Globe after the lord chamberlain's men moved from the Theatre north
            of the river to a new site south of Maid Lane on Bankside in 1599.<note type="foot"> See

                1530–1660</title>, pp 493–95.</note> Landro makes the telling point that the
            shifting demographic and a burgeoning new audience in the northern suburbs would not
            have escaped the notice of Henslowe and Alleyn, even as they expanded their business
            interests in the Bear Garden.<note type="foot">See Landro, ‘Henslowe’s Relocation,’ pp
              37-8.</note> Finding a suitable property, securing funding, and negotiating a lease
            would have taken considerable time and would not likely have been deferred until 1599 by
            two partners as strategic in their thinking as Henslowe and Alleyn. When the neighbours
            were roused to protest construction of the new playhouse to the privy council early in
            1600, Alleyn was well-positioned to appeal for support to his powerful patron, the lord
            admiral, and the queen, an appreciative member of the audience at his court performances
            in times past. Subsequent organization of support for the playhouse at the community
            level, with the promise of generous tithes for the local poor, won the day.<note

              council by Lord Willoughby and other residents in the Finsbury neighbourhood of the
              proposed new Fortune playhouse on 9 March 1599/1600 (TNA: PC2/25, p 78). See Chambers,

            Henslowe supervised the construction process and assumed partnership of the Fortune in
            1600, with 'a half-share of the playhouse and its profits for a term of twenty-four
            years at an annual rent of £8.'<note type="foot"> See further Landro, 'Henslowe's

          <p>Returning to Bankside, determined patience was rewarded in 1604 when Dorrington died
            and the partners moved quickly to purchase the patent for the mastership of the bears,
            bulls, and mastiff dogs from Sir William Stewart, a Scottish friend of James I who was
            first recipient of the royal appointment. £450 was the charge for the privilege, a hefty
            sum that Henslowe and Alleyn were nonetheless able to muster for this long-desired and
            prestigious position.<note type="foot">The royal patent for the appointment was recorded
              on 24 November 1604: see TNA: C66/1648, mbs 27–8. A partial draft of the patent
              survives in DC: MS II, (transcript to be published on Henslowe-Alleyn website later
              this year).</note> Within two years they began renovations at the Bear Garden where a
            more substantial welcoming gatehouse named the Dancing Bears was built on the Bell and
            Cock site.<note type="foot">The building contract on 2 June 1606 with Gilbert Katherens

              Garden/Hope edition forthcoming in the REED series.</note></p>

          <p>Henslowe's decision to abandon renewal of the lease for the Rose in 1605 may have been
            the result of several factors, not only the proposed increase in cost of the lease.
            Since 1600 there had not been any continuity in companies resident at the aging
            playhouse while the lord admiral's men were soon flourishing at the new Fortune.
            Furthermore, the serious recurrence of plague in 1603 led to lengthy closure of the
            London area playhouses. Henslowe's Bankside priority in this period may well have been
            renovation of the Bear Garden although he also continued his acquisition of other
            properties, picking up the lease of the Great Pike Garden further west along Bankside in
              1609.<note type="foot">See Warner, <title>Catalogue</title>, vol 1, p 141, for MS V, f
              44 (not reproduced on the <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title>
              website). </note> All of his properties had houses and shops that brought regular
            income to the owner of the lease, so Henslowe was by no means dependent on the quirky
            and unpredictable fortunes of his first playhouse. Around the same time Alleyn was
            building his own substantial estate, soon acquiring the manor of Dulwich in the Surrey
            countryside where he eventually relocated.<note type="foot">Alleyn purchased the manor
              of Dulwich from Sir Francis Calton in 1606 for £5,000, with regular payments due over
              seven years. He probably relocated there from Bankside by 1612. See Jan Piggott,
                <title>Dulwich College: A History, 1616–2008</title> (London, 2008).</note> Perhaps
            for financial reasons he therefore sold Henslowe his share in the Bear Garden in
            1610/11, though he retained the share in the mastership and the Fortune Playhouse
              operation.<note type="foot">DC: MS VIII, f 5v.</note></p>

          <p xml:id="background-henslowe-status">An increase in status at court was not only
            confirmed by acquisition of the mastership of the bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs, but
            also by Henslowe's royal appointment in 1603 as a gentleman sewer of the Chamber.<note

            pensioner and granted a pension from the Crown.<note type="foot">Cerasano, 'Elizabethan
              Court,' pp 51, 53.</note> As a man of considerable property, he also assumed
            leadership roles in his home parish of St Saviour's Southwark. The opening stage may not
            have been promising. The vestry minutes of St Saviour's in 1598 note anxiety about the
            playhouses located within their parish boundaries: by 1595 Francis Langley's Swan
            theatre had opened in the manor of Paris Garden just west of Bankside. On 19 July, the
            following order was recorded: <quote source="#rosep-ridm96581496"/>'Inprimis it was
            ordered at this vestrye that a petic<ex>i</ex>on shalbe made to the bodye of the
            Councell concerninge the playehouses in this p<ex>ar</ex>yshe wherein the enormyties
            shalbe shewed that comes therebye to the p<ex>ar</ex>yshe And that in respecte thereof
            they maye be dismissed &amp; putt downe from playeinge....' There had been a previous
            order in May (renewed twice) that the churchwardens ask the playhouse owners to
            contribute tithes for the poor, but no evidence survives that they did so. However, as
            Paul White explains further in his forthcoming essay, 'Philip Henslowe and Edward Alleyn
            in Parish Politics and Service,' the social capital to be gained from actively
            participating in the lay leadership of his home parish was not lost on Henslowe. 'One
            needed to have lived in the parish for at least eight years to be a vestryman, but
            Henslowe’s name in the Token Books as a communicant the Spring of 1588, and just about
            every year thereafter, indicates that he fulfilled that requirement by about 1596 and
            was a parishioner in good standing. He was certainly wealthy enough and sufficiently
            well-connected at court in the 1590s to have qualified for the vestry. Moreover, he was
            a commissioner of the lay subsidy in 1593, 1594, and 1597, a prestigious appointment and
            reserved usually for vestrymen.'<note type="foot">See Ingram and Nelson, <ref

            regular attender at the almost monthly meetings despite his many other responsibilities.
            The following year in 1608 he was chosen churchwarden, a term renewed in 1609. In the

          <p>Following the closure of the Rose in 1605 (if not before), the final phase of
            Henslowe's career needs only be covered briefly here. Although Alleyn would continue to
            develop diversified interests elsewhere, Henslowe's focus seems to have been more on
            Bankside where he lived. By <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1612 he began planning for another
            playhouse that would combine what had been separate enterprises at the now demolished
            Rose and the ongoing Bear Garden. In 1613, with another partner, the waterman Jacob
            Meade who had been working at the Bear Garden since the late '90s, he conceived of a
            multi-purpose entertainment centre with a moveable stage, that could mount weekly plays,
            animal baitings (at least bi-weekly), and other types of amusement such as ‘flytings,’
            or contestants hurling scurrilous verse at each other. Some helpfully detailed contracts
            for the demolition of the old Bear Garden arena and construction of the Hope have
            survived to show us that Henslowe had in mind a theatre to rival in size and beauty, not
            the Globe, but rather the Swan, which seems to have ceased long since as a competitive
              operation.<note type="foot">Transcriptions of all these documents, DC: Mun 49-51, will

            represented the manager of the future at an early stage of development. Yet his ability
            to function as a manager or producer was blocked by the structure of the acting company.
            In fact, the two could not co-exist. Shared responsibility among working actors not only
            followed different procedures of decision-making but had no room for managerial
            guidance. The company needed financing but not control and, in fact, resisted control by
            a single individual ... Consciously or not, Henslowe realized, even before 1600, the
            fundamental enmity between management and company, and attempted to expand his role as
            landlord into that of manager....'<note type="foot">Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' pp
              59–60.</note> Beckerman suggests that four periods can be identified in the growth of
            Henslowe's role as a proto-theatre manager.<note type="foot">Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' p
              28. Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, pp 82–3, seems to accept Beckerman's
              identification of the four phases, while noting that the diary does not always reveal
              which role, whether as landlord or banker, Henslowe was assuming when he made his
              account entries.</note></p>

          <p>In the first phase at the Rose (he suggests up to 1596–7), Henslowe was acting
            primarily as a landlord, with less direct involvement in the company's operations. The
            second, 'late Rose-early Fortune,' period, ran from mid-1596 to early 1604, a time when
            playing companies were challenged by increasing efforts by the authorities in London and
            on privy council to control the number of playhouses and their operation, while they
            also faced more competition and plague closures. Henslowe seems to have attempted
            greater involvement as banker with lord admiral's men during this period, offering loans
            to the company during seasons of declining performance income at the Rose or at court
            (for example, 1596–7, when they were not invited). Carson's review of evidence in the
            diary for these years notes an extension of involvement in company affairs: 'Beginning
            in the Spring-Summer season of 1598, Henslowe seems to have provided most of the money
            spent on playbooks, costumes, and properties by Admiral's Men.'<note type="foot">
              <title>Companion</title>, pp 24–30, especially 27.</note> For the first time, he is
            also on record posting bonds for two actors who had defected to join Pembroke's men in
            1597 at the rival Swan playhouse, as well as for two others seeking to join lord
            admiral's men at the Rose after the controversial performance of Jonson and Nashe's
              <title>Isle of Dogs</title> play in July 1597 led to a punitive closure of the Swan
            for a longer period of time. If, as may be the case, Langley had initiated the idea of
            requiring actors to sign bonds with him before playing at the Swan, Henslowe was to
            follow his example in adopting this deeper involvement in the affairs of the lord
            admiral's men. Entries in the diary show that he required the disaffected actors
            recruited from Pembroke's men, as well as others, totalling ten altogether, to guarantee
            that they would play only at the Rose for stated terms ranging from one to three
              years.<note type="foot">Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' pp 36–42, outlines the details of the
              loans to the company and the players' bonds established by Langley and Henslowe during
              these years. See also Foakes, <title>Diary</title>, pp 238–41, for the bonds for
              Richard Jones, Robert Shaa, William Bird (alias Borne), Thomas Downton, Thomas Hearne,
              John Helle, Richard Allen, Thomas Heywood, Charles Massy, and Samuel Rowley. See
              further, <ref target="#background-playhouse">History of the Playhouse</ref>.</note> As
            this new approach was happening, Alleyn retired from the stage, leaving Henslowe to
            manage relations with the company more directly. However, despite their apparent
            dependency on periodic financial loans, the evidence suggests that he was unable to
            assert substantial control of the management of the lord admiral's men who repaid their
            debts whenever they could. 'It would appear that the landlord was satisfied to lend
            money to the players in order to keep them at his theatre, where he earned a more than
            satisfactory income from rent.'<note type="foot">Carson, <title>Companion</title>, p 27.
              A more recent review of the evidence for Henslowe's evolving management style at the
              Rose has been done by Mao, 'Rose Playhouse,' pp 146–59.</note> In other words, the
            gain was stability for the playhouse operation rather than control of the company's
            productions while in residence there.<note type="foot">The goal of 'stability' was
              recognized by Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' p 43.</note></p>

          <p>The third period highlights Henslowe's management of the Bear Garden, in partnership
            with Alleyn until 1610. The fourth and final phase Beckerman terms the 'Hope period,'
            beginning in 1611 when the new company of Lady Elizabeth's men first signed articles of
            agreement with Henslowe.<note type="foot">See further Siobhan Keenan, <title>Acting
                Companies and their Plays in Shakespeare's London</title> (London, 2014), 33–52, for
              Lady Elizabeth's men as a case study. The 1611 agreement has not survived but is
              referred to in a bond signed by actors of the company on 29 August 1611 (see further
              Gurr, <title>Shakespearian Playing Companies</title>, pp 397–8, and Greg,
                <title>Henslowe Papers</title>, p 111, for the bond, DC: MS XVIII, Article 9, also
              citing DC: Mun 47 as 'Almost identical.')</note> Almost two decades after the opening
            of the Rose, Henslowe's management style had evolved so that he was more forceful in his
            dealings with Lady Elizabeth's men. When he and Jacob Meade founded the Hope playhouse
            on Bankside in 1613, they were making plans for Lady Elizabeth's men to be resident.
            Articles of Agreement drawn up with the actor Nathan Field representing the company
            around the same time illustrate Henslowe's increasing responsibilities for providing the
            playhouse, costumes and props, influencing membership, arbitrating in cases of dispute
            and, ultimately, choice of plays commissioned.<note type="foot">DC: Mun 52. See Greg,
                <title>Henslowe Papers</title>, pp 23–5, and the <ref
                target="http://www.henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/images/Muniments-Series-1/Group-052/01r.html"
                > Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</ref>.</note> Beckerman detects subtle
            changes in the degree of control exerted: 'By gradually making actors and writers
            responsible to him rather than to the company, he took the first step toward genuine
              management.'<note type="foot">Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' p 60.</note> Articles of
            Grievance and Oppression drawn up by the company by 1615 survive in the Henslowe-Alleyn
            archive to illustrate that relations between Henslowe and the players became frayed as a
              result.<note type="foot">DC: MS I, single sheet. See Greg, <title>Henslowe
                Papers</title>, pp 86–9, and the <ref
                target="http://www.henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/images/MSS-1/Article-106/01r.html"
                >Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</ref>. See also Foakes, 'Domestical Matters,'
              p 103, for a brief assessment of why the players' articles of grievance should not be
              taken at face value, a view also shared by Carson, <title>Companion</title>, p
              32.</note></p>

          <p>When Henslowe died on 6 January 1615/16, he was a man of wealth and property, drawing
            income from numerous rentals, various court appointments, and successful business
            ventures that centred on entertainment, primarily on Bankside. He appears to have kept
            his investments and partnerships under effective control during his lifetime, but once
            gone, the rights to his estate became subject to bitter conflict and interminable court
            cases that will be the focus of the digital edition for the Bear Garden/Hope records
            forthcoming in the REED series. Was Henslowe really worth the £10,000 to £12,000 that
            his avaricious nephew claimed and clearly wanted a slice of? Poor Agnes, who inherited
            the bulk of the estate, was described in a dispute over the will, as ‘aged almost 100
            yeares and grown Childishe and very simple’ (if she was indeed such a venerable age,
            then she would have given birth at an almost biblical age of maturity). Edward Alleyn
            was accused of ‘most cunninglie’ insinuating himself into the process of drawing up a
            version of the will during Henslowe’s final hours.<note type="foot">TNA: C 33/133 A (17
              November 1616), ff 240v–1.</note> For quite a few years a formerly functional family
            and partnerships fell into disarray but it is worth noting that Alleyn, also a man of
            influence and strategy, was well-placed as son-in-law to Agnes Henslowe to inherit much
            of the estate left to her by her husband.</p>

            <p> From the reference here to the 'playe howse now in framinge' it is apparent that the
              playhouse foundations had been started before 10 January 1586/7. It is equally clear
              from the description of the 'smalle ten<ex>emen</ex>te or dwellinge howsse scittuate
              and standinge at the sowthe ende' of the property that <rs

                >John Cholmley </rs>already held a lease on that tenement, which was to become a
              potentially lucrative victualling house for the playhouse. His small building is shown
              on John Norden's maps of 1593 and 1600 in the southwest corner of the Little Rose
              site. For more on the late twentieth-century excavation of the site and Cholmley's
              house, see Bowsher and Miller, <title>Rose and the Globe</title>, pp 24–32, 111.</p>

            <p> Also mentioned in the deed is the builder <rs

            <p> This order was never carried out and may not have been related to the performance of
                <title>The Isle of Dogs</title> during the same summer as some have assumed: see
              William Ingram, 'The Closing of the Theaters in 1597: A Dissenting View,'
                <title>Modern Philology</title> 69.2 (November 1971), 105–15. Glynne Wickham, while
              subscribing to the view that the order should be seen in the context of the
                <title>Isle of Dogs</title> production, has pointed out that the intention of the
              order was essentially a restraint of public performances in London for three months
              only rather than outright suppression of all theatres. In fact, playing resumed at the
              Curtain and the Rose (but not the Swan) in October and November 1597. As he notes, <rs

              season and both enjoyed the patronage of members of the privy council, so rehearsing
              for a royal audience would have facilitated their return to those two public stages in
              the autumn. See further 'The Privy Council Order of 1597 for the Destruction of all
              London's Theatres,' <title>The Elizabethan Theatre: Papers given at the International

            <p> Most of the plays named in the inventories appear in Henslowe's diary and have been
              noted from the Foakes edition and, where relevant, the <title>Lost Plays
                Database</title>, Roslyn L. Knutson, David McInnis, and Matthew Steggle (eds),
              https://www.lostplays.org/ <del>accessed <!-- CB to provide date --></del>. For more
              details on each, see Wiggins, <title>British Drama</title>, vols 2–4. Very few of
              those named survive. Wiggins' titles have been followed for each in the textual
              notes.</p>

            <p> Carson, <title>Companion</title>, pp 49–50, notes several puzzles presented by this
              document: 'Not the least of these is the identity of the author. The phrase "I have
              bought" sounds suspiciously like <rs
                ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129736/" type="Person_Commoner"
                >Henslowe</rs>, and if indeed he is the compiler of the list then the words probably
              mean no more than "have lent the actors to buy". The fact that one of the plays on the
              list <title>Vayvode</title>, belonged to <rs
                ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/153045/" type="Person_Commoner"
                >Edward Alleyn</rs> in January 1599 raises the possibility that he may have been the
              "I" in question' (p 49). Carson further outlines other anomalies, such as omission on
              the list of playbooks of some plays known from the diary to have been staged or
              purchased in the same period. Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, p 103,
              favours Henslowe as the compiler of the list of plays owned by the company, but with
              the exclusion of those still owned by Alleyn.</p>

              the astrological symbol for Mars indicates that 4 March fell on a Tuesday, as it did
              in 1599/1600 but not 1600/1 (with thanks to Alan H. Nelson for this note and his
              revision of the date). Rowse, <title>Simon Forman</title>, p 15, dated the entry as 4
              March but both Cerasano, 'Philip Henslowe, Simon Forman,' p 158, and Lupic, 'Early
              Performances,' p 99, n 5, misread the date as 9 March.</p>

            <p> However, as Lupic points out, the entry for 15 March 1599/1600 indicates that
              Cerasano (p 158) misdates Forman's attendance at the performance of <title>Sir John
                Oldcastle</title> in the following comment: 'On 16 October 1600, in the final
              performances of the Lord Admiral's Men at the Rose, Forman attended <title>Sir John
                Oldcastle</title>, although it is unclear whether Forman saw Part 1 or Part 2 of the
              play.' Lupic (p 99) points out that on '12 March <rs

                <title>Sir John Oldcastle</title>, and given the closeness of these dates the most
              plausible interpretation is that the play Forman saw was indeed the freshly mounted
              second part.' In any case Forman's primary purpose in noting the performance was to
              record the address of a woman he was interested in <rs

              in dating the performance of <title>Sir John Oldcastle</title> as Thursday, 16
              October, and includes the possibility that the play was Part 1 rather than Part 2.
