        <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
          establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
          contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
          and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
          communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
          closed the London theatres.</p>

          <p>This collection of Rose Playhouse records is the first digital edition of London area
            Renaissance and Jacobean playhouses for the <title>REED Online</title> series. As
            editor, I have delighted in the support and expertise of several members of the REED
            editorial team. Tanya Hagen, REED's bibliographer and now managing editor, has been an
            invaluable companion along the way, first as our research paths converged while she
            edited the Rose bibliographic data for the <title>Early Modern London Theatres</title>
            website and lately as bibliographic support for and production manager of the completed
            collection. Tanya has also contributed the modernizations of the Records text, in
            response to our external readers' recommendations. I am also grateful to REED's
            associate editor and paleographer, Patrick Gregory, who checked all transcriptions and
            contributed the English glossary entries; and to our research associate, Illya Nokhrin,
            who assisted in content checking the editorial apparatus, indexed the collection and
            made a significant contribution to mapping all locations named with related events for
            the new timeline feature. Stephanie Hovland, my co-editor for the forthcoming Bear
            Gardens/Hope edition, also assisted in on-site work at an earlier stage of research.</p>

          <p>My long-time collaborator, Byron Moldofsky, deserves special mention for his
            cartographic skills and ongoing interest in developing a more ambitious project to map
            not only the Southwark area in historic detail but also the wider London area for more
            playhouse editions to come. It was his initiative to develop the timeline feature for
            the Rose, in collaboration with Dave Luxton, our web designer, Rory McClanahan, web
            programmer, and Illya Nokhrin. It has been a real pleasure to work with all members of
            this creative team.</p>

          <p>The <title>Rose Playhouse</title> collection, like other REED digital editions, would
            not appear on our screens without the expertise and advice of our programmer, Jamie
            Norrish, who has incorporated manuscript images to complement transcriptions for the
            first time, as well as the enhanced mapping and timeline.</p>

          <p>The inclusion of manuscript digital images has been made possible through friendly
            permissions granted by the following archives: The National Archives, The British
            Library, and the London Metropolitan Archives (City of London). My thanks to Paul Johnson
            (TNA), and Laurence Ward and Wendy Hawke (LMA), for responding to my requests for help
            with permission to publish transcriptions. I am grateful to the Trust for London for the
            1650 lease of the Little Rose Estate, and to Justine Horseman Sewell and Southwark

            river to link the city of London and lands south and southeast of the river from Roman
            times until the eighteenth century, so its presence there was key to the development of
            Southwark as a zone of hospitality for travellers, notably Chaucer's pilgrims to
              Canterbury.<note type="foot">See further Martha Carlin, <title>Medieval

              industries' (some of them, as for example slaughterhouses and tanning, less
              salubrious) is also noted.</note> The lordship of the manor was acquired by <rs

            fields, meadows, and pastures. At the northeast corner of the estate, the bishop and his
            successors built a palace to serve as their London area residence: the great hall's west
            end wall with the stone tracery of its fine rose window remains standing on the south
            side of modern Clink Street as a silent witness to the former grandeur of the episcopal

            Development of the rest of the estate for urban uses followed gradually, with smaller

              suppression.<note type="foot">Henry VIII's royal proclamation against the stews

            Maiden or Maid Lane, running parallel to the river and south of Bankside, was named and
            known as early as the mid-thirteenth century and may indicate that prostitution was
            already flourishing by then.<note type="foot">Maid Lane is now modern Park Street. For

              Carlin's work for her PhD dissertation (see 'Urban Development') also remains an
              important source for the history of the area.</note></p>
          <p>The property called the Rose stretched from Bankside to Maid Lane and was owned by
            William Spence, a fishmonger of London, in the early years of the sixteenth
              century.<note type="foot">In June 1537 Spence, then of Great Palgrave, Norfolk, but
              previously citizen and stockfishmonger of London, sold the Great Rose to Henry
              Polsted; for the deed, see TNA: E 326/12364.</note> By this time the Little Rose had
            been segregated from the 'Great Rose,' so its subsequent history evolves under different
            ownership. However, the deed drawn up for Spence's sale of the Great Rose names a <rs
              ref="eats:126979" type="Person_Commoner">Ralph Symonds</rs> as owner of the property
            just east of the Great Rose. This refers to the smaller section of the Little Rose which
            fronted on the Thames; the larger section of the property extended from behind the
            Hartshorn Inn to Maid Lane.<note type="foot">See the map and Carlin, 'Urban

            make a charitable bequest of the Little Rose property in perpetuity following her death.
            Income from its rents would contribute to support of the poor from her parish, <rs

            and from Christ's Hospital, as well as needy fishermen in Old Fish Street. The deed,
            dated 3 December 1552, names as trustees or feoffees two gentlemen from Kent as well as
            sixteen others, very likely from St Mildred's parish. From Thomasyn's death in 1555
            onward, the trust seems to have been managed by representatives from the parish. The
            description of the estate in the deed indicates that some urban development had
            occurred: 'all that my mesuage or ten<ex>emen</ex>t called the little Roose with two

            mention of 'pond<ex>es</ex>' suggests that, like the neighbouring pike gardens to the
            west, the Little Rose still had some fishponds at the time. The marshy land along
            Bankside had been used in recent centuries for breeding freshwater fish, especially
            pike, in ponds maintained by London fishmongers like Ralph Symonds. </p>
          <p>On 20 November 1574 six of eight named parishioners of St Mildred's Bread Street signed
            a thirty-one year lease for the Little Rose 'messuage or Tenement' with <rs

          <p>Early modern mapping of London was sporadic, mostly derivative, and pictorial – not
            true cartography until 1676.<note type="foot">The first true cartography was done by
              John Ogilby and William Morgan. For a full view see 'Ogilby and Morgan's Large Scale

            woodcut map published in 1633 but really based on a finer copperplate map produced <hi
              rend="italic">c</hi> 1560, of which only three sections remain extant for
              comparison.<note type="foot">For a full digital reproduction of the Agas map (from the

              Publication 159 (London, 2001).</note> Sadly, none show Southwark. The Agas version of
            the south bank to the east of Lambeth Marsh depicts the string of houses along the edge
            of the river, labelled ‘The Banck,’ with gardens stretching behind. Just a sampling of
            the more extensive fish ponds, or 'pike gardens,' south of the bank is represented and
            there are no theatres in view, a sure clue that the Agas map was based on an earlier,
            pre-1576 version of London. By the mid-sixteenth century, however, there is documentary
            evidence to support the existence of bearbaiting arenas in Southwark and these are
            suggested in the two circular arenas just south of the bank, one titled 'The bolle
            bayting' and the other, to the east, 'The Bearebayting.' We should assume considerable
            artistic licence here. The precise locations of the arenas remain in question, but the
            views available suggest that when Withens took over the lease, the Little Rose estate
            consisted of very few buildings along the river with two as yet undeveloped 'gardens'
            stretching behind.</p>

          <p>The next document of interest relating to the Little Rose has deeper significance for
            the history of London theatre. On 10 January 1586/7 Henslowe signed a deed of
            partnership with a London grocer, <rs ref="eats:130879" type="Person_Commoner">John
              Cholmley</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm90584488"/>.</note> Their
            joint venture was, in fact, the <rs ref="eats:157260" type="Place_F_Playhouse">first
              playhouse</rs> to be built in Southwark, on the Little Rose property recently leased
            by Henslowe. The basic dimensions of the property are described as approximately
            ninety-four feet square. By the time the deed was being drawn up, the playhouse was 'now
            in framinge and shortly to be ereckted.' It seems likely that Henslowe, an entrepreneur
            just beginning to make his mark in Southwark, conceived of the plan and made a start to
            raise a playhouse, with the help of <rs ref="eats:131126" type="Person_Commoner">John
              Griggs</rs> the carpenter, in an area more readily accessible to London audiences than
            the <rs ref="eats:227741" type="Place_F_Playhouse">earlier playhouse at Newington</rs>,
            about a mile from the river, south of Southwark.<note type="foot">For a full-length

                Newington Butts</title>, Routledge Studies in Shakespeare 24 (New York and London,
              2018).</note> However, there was a small house or tenement at the southwest end of the
            property by Maid Lane that already had a tenant, whether resident or not.<note
              type="foot">The Token Books surviving sporadically between 1571 and 1588 do not list a
              John Cholmley (or variant surname) as a Southwark resident.</note> Although the terms
            of the sub-lease for this tenement have not been discovered, the deed of partnership
            makes clear that John Cholmley was the tenant and therefore an agreement of some sort
            with him would probably have been required in order to build the playhouse adjacent on
            the garden plot. </p>
          <p>The partnership agreed to between Henslowe and his tenant Cholmley was potentially
            profitable for both. As Bowsher and Cerasano summarize the terms, 'Cholmley was to pay
            Henslowe £816 in instalments over the course of eight and a quarter years but not
            starting until 25 June [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>, for 24 June], the feast day of St
            John the Baptist. This clearly shows that Henslowe had enough ready money to finance the
            bulk of construction costs himself. In return, Cholmley would receive a half-share in
            the profits of the plays, and have exclusive right to the catering and victualling of
            the enterprise run from his house. Moreover, both men would be allowed to admit their
            friends to performances without charging admission fees. Henslowe would finance the
            construction of the playhouse and pay all rents as of 29 September 1587, suggesting that
            this was the target date for the Rose’s opening. According to the deed, although
            Cholmley and Henslowe would share maintenance expenses of the playhouse thereafter and
            throughout the period covered by the agreement, Henslowe appears to have financed all of
            the major expenses before the playhouse was operable.'<note type="foot"> Julian Bowsher

          <p>The partnership would expire on Lady Day, 25 March 1595, but after the agreement early
            in 1587 Cholmley virtually disappears from the record. The only other mentions of
            Cholmley amongst the Henslowe-Alleyn papers after 1587 are a couple of scribbles,
            perhaps pen trials, on f 1 of Henslowe’s diary. William Ingram has persuasively
            identified this shadowy character as John Cholmley, originally from Bletchingley,
            Surrey, where he began his career as a tanner, following his father's trade, before
            achieving the freedom of the city as a member of the Grocers' company.<note type="foot"

              especially 45–50.</note> This Cholmley died a mere two years into the contract, in
            April 1589, so Henslowe would have assumed the profits from the joint enterprise
            thenceforth, according to the terms of the partnership agreement.<note type="foot"

              reason to identify him with the king’s player, Thomas Pope, who died in the same year
              (TNA: PROB 10/224). Rutter notes that the Rose was not among the three playhouses

          <p>The lease of the Little Rose was soon to come due for renewal in 1605 but the new terms
            increasing the annual rent to £20 with a further 100 marks (equivalent to almost £66)
            required for building repairs were obviously unappealing. It seems most likely that
            Henslowe followed through on his threat to abandon the playhouse. Closure of the
            theatres during the plague year of 1603 and subsequently for periods during 1604 and
            1605 may have further contributed to his decision.<note type="foot">See further F.P.

            taken for the commissioners of Sewers in 1605 witness to his steadfast refusal to pay
            for repairs and removal of two posts standing in the sewer under his bridge by the
            playhouse. On 14 December 1604 he had claimed that he 'hath not any lands against the
            sewar in Roase aley' – not true at the time of course, but within the year, on 29
            September 1605, his lease of the Little Rose estate expired.<note type="foot">See <ptr

            The next entry relating to the Rose in the sewer commissioners’ minutes, on 30 January
            1605/6, names 'Box of Bredstreete in London,' perhaps one of the feoffees of the
            Thomasyn Symonds Charity, St Mildred's Bread Street, as the person responsible for
            related property maintenance costs.<note type="foot">See <ptr

              original feoffees named in Thomasyn Symonds' deed of bequest. Unfortunately, the
              parish registers surviving for St Mildred's Bread Street do not begin until the
              mid-seventeenth century, so tracing personal details for either William or <rs

              there are no other parish records extant for St Mildred's Bread Street that might help
              determine the administration of the Symonds Charity. See further Bowsher, <title>Rose
                Theatre</title>, p 57, n 6.</note> By 25 April Edward Box appears again in the sewer

          <p>What has been best known about Henslowe is thanks to the remarkable survival of the
            commonly termed 'diary' – really a memorandum book in which he made rough jottings about
            the theatre business (mainly 1591/2–1604), including playhouse repairs, income from play
            performances, loans to actors and playwrights; his pawn business (1593–6); and other
            miscellaneous entries relating, for example, to property purchases in Sussex, home
            remedies, and aphorisms.<note type="foot">See Susan Cerasano, 'Henslowe's "Curious"

              approach to Henslowe's book, examining it as an artifact made up of all its many

            became the focus of lengthy acrimonious disputes following his death in 1616.</p>
          <p>Philip Henslowe came from a prosperous gentry family with some social status in the
            county of Sussex. He was the fourth of seven children born to Edmond Henslowe (or
            Hensley) and Margaret Ridge, who resided near Lindfield, Sussex.<note type="foot">A

            men, in 1592 would bring a deep and lasting personal and professional relationship for
            both men that would impact the Elizabethan theatre industry profoundly.</p>
          <p>Although Henslowe retained his identity as a member of the Dyers’ Company, his business
            interests ranged much more widely than the textile industry. Records are scanty for his
            activities until he commenced his acquisition of property on <rs ref="eats:229072"
              type="Place_F_Street">Bankside</rs> with the purchase of the lease for the Little Rose
            in 1584/5.<note type="foot">See <ref target="#background-property">History of the Rose
                Property</ref>.</note> From that purchase onward, Henslowe's strategic path to
            success in business, property development, and court appointments, as well as his rising
            social status in the parish of St Saviour's Southwark, is fascinating to trace.</p>
          <p>The purchase of the Little Rose lease was surely not a random choice. As the map of
            Southwark shows at a glance, the Little Rose property, adjacent on its west side to the
            Great Rose, was also only a few steps from the <rs ref="eats:227798"
              type="Place_F_Arena">Bear Garden</rs> flourishing then at the Bell and Cock site, a
            little further west of the Great Rose. Documentary evidence from the mid-sixteenth
            century confirms that <rs ref="eats:21767" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport"
              >bearbaiting</rs> was likely the earliest form of popular entertainment on Bankside,
            apart from the notorious brothels that had lined the south bank of the river since at
            least the fourteenth century.<note type="foot">See further Carlin, 'Urban Development,'
              vol 2, pp 478–509.</note> In fact, a seventy-seven-year-old witness named John Taylor
            in a 1620 court case recalled that there had been four bearbaiting arenas at various
            locations in Southwark over the course of decades.<note type="foot">Court of Exchequer

              digital edition in the REED series, Stephanie Hovland and MacLean (eds).</note></p>
          <p>Some may have railed against bearbaitings at the time but, in the early 1580s, that was
            the main game on the south bank and likely a lucrative one too. Much of the audience may
            have come across the river by ferry or on foot but there was also a long string of inns
            along the high street of Southwark leading to London Bridge, including the famous Tabard
            where Chaucer’s pilgrims gathered before their trek to Canterbury. When Henslowe
            arrived, the area was therefore already established for rough sports with audience
            appeal, but there was no playhouse yet. The only playhouse south of the river was much
            further south, at <rs ref="eats:227741" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Newington Butts</rs>,
            by then no longer under the management of the actor <rs ref="eats:202508"
              type="Person_Commoner">Jerome Savage</rs>, and less conveniently located. The <rs
              ref="eats:228217" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Theatre</rs> and the <rs ref="eats:228083"
              type="Place_F_Playhouse">Curtain</rs> were the only other playhouses open at this
            time but they were across the river, north of the city walls. Did Henslowe, a man with
            enterpreneurial instincts and considerable ambition, see an opportunity to expand the
            entertainment options on Bankside by building the first Southwark playhouse on the
            Little Rose site? The evidence suggests that he did.</p>
          <p>When Henslowe purchased the lease of the Little Rose, there no longer seems doubt that
            he had money of his own to invest but his marriage to Harry Woodward's widow must have
            consolidated his financial position further. Judging by the terms of the lease, there
            were already houses and shops on the property, so he could count on steady income from
            rentals for at least twenty more years, when the lease had to be renewed.<note
              type="foot"><ptr target="#rosep-ridm90656952"/>.</note> But he may have had more on
            his mind than rental income.</p>
          <p>Within a short space of time, he must have hired the carpenter, <rs ref="eats:131126"
              type="Person_Commoner">John Griggs</rs>, to begin building a playhouse: by January
            1586/7, less than two years after the lease was signed, the deed of partnership with <rs
              ref="eats:130879" type="Person_Commoner">John Cholmley</rs> mentions the 'playe howse
            now in framinge.'<note type="foot">For the deed of partnership see <ptr
                target="#rosep-ridm90584488"/>. Mary Edmond, 'The Builder of the Rose Theatre,'
                <title>Theatre Notebook</title> 44.2 (1990), 50–4, provides further biographical
              information on John Griggs, Henslowe's builder and friend.</note> The partnership deed
            itself secured the details of Cholmley's involvement in running concessions for the Rose
            while also avoiding conflict over the location of the playhouse near the small house at
            the Little Rose, for which he probably held an ongoing sub-lease. It is evident,
            however, that it was Henslowe's initial investment that launched the development of the
            Rose.</p>
          <p>The exact opening date of the Rose is not recorded but it is generally agreed to have
            been in operation by October 1587, when some of the local residents had apparently
            complained of the new arrival on the Bankside scene. A letter from the privy council to
            the <rs ref="eats:160152" type="Collective_Office">Surrey justices of the peace</rs> on
            29 October 1587 outlines the protest as follows:</p>

            in Southwarke.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92853384"/></note> There
            can be no doubt that the plays were performed at the Rose, the only playhouse located in
            the Clink at that time. In fact, more than a decade would elapse before the <rs
              ref="eats:227836" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Globe</rs> opened there on the south
            side of <rs ref="eats:229091" type="Place_F_Street">Maid Lane</rs>.</p>
          <p>With the opening of the Rose in 1587, Henslowe launched his role as a playhouse
            landlord in earnest. Sometime between 1587 and 1590 he attracted an acting troupe of
            notable talent to make the Rose their preferred base of operations. We can now say with
            some confidence that this company, <rs ref="eats:153197" type="Collective_Troupe">Lord
              Strange’s men</rs>, did not aim to pursue the provincial touring habits of their
            predecessors. Presumably they recognized the potential of the burgeoning entertainment
            market of London, even as Henslowe did, so finding a stable base for performance at the
            Rose would have been appealing. <note type="foot">See further Manley and MacLean,
                <title>Lord Strange's Men</title>, pp 37-63, for formation of the troupe and the
              apparent preference for London.</note></p>
          <p>Sometime during this same period Henslowe began expanding his network in various
            directions. By <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1590, he had gained his first appointment at
            court. The <rs ref="eats:137174" type="Collective_Occupations">watermen's</rs> petition
            to the <rs ref="eats:25845" type="Person_Male">lord admiral</rs> is the first surviving
            record to refer to Henslowe as 'one of the groomes of her ma<ex>ies</ex>ties
              Chamber'.<note type="foot">For more detail on this and other court appointments
              throughout Henslowe's life, see Cerasano, 'Elizabethan Court,' p 50.</note> Around
            this time he also met and established an increasingly close relationship with Edward
            Alleyn, the leading actor of the lord admiral's men.</p>
          <p>Alleyn was born on 1 September 1566 in the parish of St Botolph without Bishopgate, the
            second of five sons born to a London innkeeper, Edward Alleyn (d. 1570) and Margaret
              Towneley.<note type="foot">For Alleyn's family origins and early life, see Cerasano,
              'Alleyn's Early Years,' 237–43; see also Cerasano's fuller biography of Alleyn,

              College,' <title>ODNB</title>, accessed 5 January 2023, and Piggott, <title>Dulwich
                College</title>, pp 1–55.</note> Young Edward chose a different and more ambitious
            path than his father but retained an interest in the family's properties in Bishopsgate
            and, as his career and property acquisitions expanded, an even wider area north of the
            City wall.<note type="foot">See Cerasano, 'Alleyn's Early Years,' pp 238–40.</note>
            Edward Alleyn would make his name first in the early 1580s as an actor in the provinces
            with Worcester's Men before moving to join his brother John in the Lord Admiral's Men by
            1589, possibly even earlier.<note type="foot">For details on Worcester's Men and
              speculation about the date of Alleyn's move to the Lord Admiral's Men see Chambers,
                <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 137–8; and Gurr, <title>Shakespearian
                Playing Companies</title>, pp 18, 232–4.</note> The Admiral's Men were featured at
            Court at Christmas 1588 and 1589, with subsequent appearances at Shrovetide both years:
            it is generally accepted that Alleyn had become a star performer by this time, his
            reputation established by his leading role in Marlowe's <title>Tamburlaine the
              Great</title>.<note type="foot">See further S.P. Cerasano, 'Edward Alleyn, the New
              Model Actor, and the Rise of the Celebrity in the 1590s,' <title>MRDE</title> 18

          <p> The precise date when Alleyn left the Admiral's men to combine forces with Strange's
            men has not been established but sometime in the 1590–1 period is very plausible. The
            touring licence during the plague year issued to Strange's men by the privy council on 6
            May 1593 includes Alleyn, still named as 's<ex>er</ex>uaunt to the right honorable the
              L<ex>ord</ex> highe Admiral,' but it also refers to the troupe as 'al one companie
              s<ex>er</ex>uant<ex>es</ex> to o<ex>u</ex>r verie good the L<ex>or</ex>d the

                <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, p 123.</note> Apparently Alleyn retained
            his individual affiliation with his influential patron, the lord admiral, but at some
            point moved to join Strange's men at the Rose. In October 1592 he married Henslowe's
            step-daughter, Joan, so the personal bonds were strong from at least that year forward
            if not before. <note type="foot"> For a biography of Alleyn's multi-faceted life, see

          <p>An intriguing confusion in court records of payment for performances during the 1590/1
            Christmas and Shrovetide seasons may be evidence of an even earlier association of
            Alleyn with Henslowe and Strange's men. The treasurer of the chamber accounts record
            payment on 7 March 1590/1 to the actor George Attwell, on behalf of Strange's men, for
            two performances by his company on 27 December 1590 and 16 February 1590/1.<note

              further discussion in Manley and MacLean, <title>Lord Strange's Men</title>, pp

            Andrew Gurr has suggested that this was not an instance of a fleeting amalgamation of
            the two companies.<note type="foot"><title>Theatre Research International</title> 18.2
              (1993), 85–93.</note> Rather, because Charles Howard, the lord admiral, was present at
            the 5 March privy council meeting, the official record made at the time acknowledged
            Alleyn's primary affiliation, in deference, though he was performing on both occasions
            with Strange's men. In any case, Alleyn was to become Henslowe's key professional
            partner in several entertainment ventures and they were to prosper together for many
            years on Bankside and beyond. </p>
          <p>The history of the Rose playhouse itself has been outlined in the previous section of
            this introduction. Following his older brother John's death in 1591, Henslowe inherited
            the memorandum book in which John had earlier recorded some of his Sussex mining
            accounts (1576–81).<note type="foot">See Cerasano, 'Henslowe's Biography,' pp 67–8, and
              Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, pp xix-xxiv.</note> By 19 February 1591/2, he
            began to add notes of his own so a more detailed picture of theatrical performances and
            further renovations of the playhouse emerges, thanks to its survival – unique for the
            era. But Henslowe did not rest with managing this innovative venture. Rather, with
            Alleyn as partner, he moved ahead with what looks like a strategic plan to acquire more
            lands on Bankside as well as the monopoly on the lucrative bearbaiting enterprise. In
            December 1594 Edward Alleyn bought the lease of the Bear Garden properties at the Bell
            and Cock from Thomas Burnaby – that purchase included an arena, bear house, bull house,
            cottage, stable, and hayloft. He also was licensed as a deputy by Ralph Bowes, then the
            court-appointed master of the bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs, to hold games on the site,
            with obvious profits to be made from paying customers.<note type="foot">See Alleyn's
              Memorandum Book, DC: MS VIII, f 5v, where he notes the cost of the Bear Garden lease
              as £200: Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, p 301, and the

                target="https://henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/catalogue/mss-8/005-verso/">5v</ref>. The
              licence cost a further £250. When Alleyn sold his stake to Henslowe in February
              1610/11, he calculated his annual profit from the venture at £60 per annum for a total
              of £960. Quoted by Greg, <title>Henslowe Papers</title>, p 107.</note> Half the

          </p>
          <p>With the consolidation of property along Bankside, Henslowe and Alleyn began developing
            a joint venture for acquiring monopoly of the bearbaiting games there, including the
            court appointment as master of the bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs. The master had a
            number of privileges beyond the lustre of the court appointment. There was a reward each
            time a baiting was held at one of the royal palaces such as <rs ref="eats:124560"
              type="Place_F_Residence">Whitehall</rs> – and the queen, nobility, and foreign
            visitors did delight in this type of entertainment. The master also had sole right to
            license the many touring bearwards on the provincial circuits, while also receiving a
            percentage of their profits. And then there were the profits from the Bear Garden
            itself, as well as from the breeding and sale of mastiffs.<note type="foot">See further
              Cerasano, 'Master of the Bears,' pp 195–209.</note> There were expenses too, of
            course, but there is no doubt that Henslowe and Alleyn were aiming for the appointment
            soon after the acquisition of the Bear Garden lease at the Bell and Cock. Letters
            indicating that they held this ambition survive from 1598, the year when the master,
            Ralph Bowes, sickened and died. On 4 June, Henslowe wrote to Alleyn as follows: </p>

          <p>Very disappointingly, as Henslowe had suspected, John Dorrington, the gentleman
            pensioner of Nottinghamshire referred to above, was indeed appointed master of the
            bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs in August following Bowes' death.<note type="foot">TNA:
              C66/1485, mb 29, records the letters patent for Dorrington's appointment on 11 August
              1598.</note> The friendly assistance of their mutual friend, Arthur Langworth of The
            Brill, Ringmere, in Sussex, had been to no avail, nor had other lobbying efforts at

          <p>The mention in the letter of 'ower other matter betwext vs' is intriguing. By 1598
            Alleyn had taken his leave of the stage and would not return until the opening of a new
            playhouse in 1600 to be occupied by the lord admiral's men – the Fortune, located on
            Whitecross Street in the parish of St Giles without Cripplegate just north of the city
            walls. Both Victor Landro and Susan Cerasano have persuasively argued that this move was
            at the planning stage for the two partners during Alleyn's brief retirement and predated
            Alleyn's acquisition of the lease for the site in December 1599.<note type="foot">For

            narrative that the lord admiral's men were forced to abandon the Rose because of
            competition from the Globe after the <rs ref="eats:127834" type="Collective_Troupe">lord

            Landro makes the telling point that the shifting demographic and a burgeoning new
            audience in the northern suburbs would not have escaped the notice of Henslowe and
            Alleyn, even as they expanded their business interests in the Bear Garden.<note
              type="foot">See Landro, ‘Henslowe’s Relocation,’ pp 37-8.</note> Finding a suitable
            property, securing funding, and negotiating a lease would have taken considerable time
            and would not likely have been deferred until 1599 by two partners as strategic in their
            thinking as Henslowe and Alleyn. When the neighbours were roused to protest construction
            of the new playhouse to the privy council early in 1600, Alleyn was well-positioned to
            appeal for support to his powerful patron, the lord admiral, and the queen, an
            appreciative member of the audience at his court performances in times past. Subsequent
            organization of support for the playhouse at the community level, with the promise of
            generous tithes for the local poor, won the day.<note type="foot">Documents relating to

            negotiations, but Henslowe supervised the construction process and assumed partnership
            of the Fortune in 1600, with 'a half-share of the playhouse and its profits for a term
            of twenty-four years at an annual rent of £8.'<note type="foot"> See further Landro,

          <p>Back on Bankside, the determined patience of the partners was rewarded in 1604 when
            Dorrington died. They moved quickly to purchase the patent for the mastership of the
            bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs from Sir William Stewart, a Scottish friend of James I
            who was first recipient of the royal appointment. £450 was the charge for the privilege,
            a hefty sum that Henslowe and Alleyn were nonetheless able to muster for this
            long-desired and prestigious position.<note type="foot">The royal patent for the
              appointment was recorded on 24 November 1604: see TNA: C66/1648, mbs 27–8. A partial

          <p>It is worth noting that Alleyn retired permanently from his acting career around the
            same time. By 1604 patronage of the Admiral's Men had been taken over by the heir to the
            throne, Prince Henry. As leader of the Prince's Men in King James' deferred coronation
            progress of 15 March 1603/4, Alleyn joined the glittering occasion to deliver a speech
            as Genius Urbis at the first pageant arch in Fenchurch Street but it may have been one
            of his final appearances.<note type="foot">For the account of the master of the Great

          <p>Henslowe's decision to abandon renewal of the lease for the Rose in 1605 may have been
            the result of several factors, not only the proposed increase in cost of the lease.
            Since 1600 there had not been any continuity in companies resident at the aging
            playhouse while the lord admiral's men were soon flourishing at the new Fortune.
            Furthermore, the serious recurrence of plague in 1603 led to lengthy closure of the
            London area playhouses. Henslowe's Bankside priority in this period may well have been
            renovation of the Bear Garden although he also continued his acquisition of other
            properties, picking up the lease of the Great Pike Garden further west along Bankside in
              1609.<note type="foot">See Warner, <title>Catalogue</title>, vol 1, p 141, for MS V, f
              44 (not reproduced on the <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title>
              website). </note> All of his properties had houses and shops that brought regular
            income to the owner of the lease, so Henslowe was by no means dependent on the quirky
            and unpredictable fortunes of his first playhouse. Around the same time Alleyn was
            building his own substantial estate, soon acquiring the manor of Dulwich in the Surrey
            countryside where he eventually relocated.<note type="foot">He noted his purchase of the
              manor of Dulwich from Sir Francis Calton in his memorandum book on 20 October 1605 for
              £5,000, with regular payments due over seven years; see DC: MS VIII, f 8v, Ioppolo,
                <ref target="https://henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/catalogue/mss-8/008-verso"
                  ><title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title></ref>. Alleyn also purchased
              the manors of Lewisham, Kent, in 1600 and Kennington, Surrey, in 1604; see Piggott,
                <title>Dulwich College</title>, p 29.</note> Perhaps for financial reasons he
            therefore sold Henslowe his share in the Bear Garden in 1610/11, though he retained the
            share in the mastership and the Fortune Playhouse operation.<note type="foot">DC: MS

          <p xml:id="background-henslowe-status">An increase in status at court was not only
            confirmed by acquisition of the mastership of the bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs, but
            also by Henslowe's royal appointment in 1603 as a gentleman sewer of the Chamber.<note

              >St Saviour's Southwark</rs>. The opening of the relationship may not have been
            promising. The vestry minutes of St Saviour's in 1598 note anxiety about the playhouses
            located within their parish boundaries: by 1595 <rs ref="eats:151032"

              type="Place_F_Playhouse">Swan theatre</rs> had opened in the manor of Paris Garden
            just west of Bankside. On 19 July, the following order was recorded: 'Inprimis it was
            ordered at this vestrye that a petic<ex>i</ex>on shalbe made to the bodye of the

                target="#rosep-ridm96581496"/></note> There had been a previous order in May
            (renewed twice) that the churchwardens ask the playhouse owners to contribute tithes for
            the poor, but no evidence survives that they did so. However, as Paul White explains
            further in his forthcoming essay, 'Philip Henslowe and Edward Alleyn in Parish Politics
            and Service,' the social capital to be gained from actively participating in the lay
            leadership of his home parish was not lost on Henslowe. 'One needed to have lived in the
            parish for at least eight years to be a vestryman, but Henslowe’s name in the Token
            Books as a communicant in the Spring of 1588, and just about every year thereafter,
            indicates that he fulfilled that requirement by about 1596 and was a parishioner in good
            standing. He was certainly wealthy enough and sufficiently well-connected at court in
            the 1590s to have qualified for the vestry. Moreover, he was a commissioner of the lay
            subsidy in 1593, 1594, and 1597, a prestigious appointment and reserved usually for
              vestrymen.'<note type="foot">See Ingram and Nelson, <ref

            regular attender at the almost monthly meetings despite his many other responsibilities.
            The following year in 1608 he was chosen churchwarden, a term renewed in 1609. In the
            latter year he was also appointed as one of the governors of St Saviour's Grammar

          <p>Following the closure of the Rose in 1605 (if not before), the final phase of
            Henslowe's career needs only be covered briefly here. Although Alleyn would continue to
            develop diversified interests elsewhere, Henslowe's focus seems to have been more on
            Bankside where he lived. By <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1612 he began planning for another
            playhouse that would combine what had been separate enterprises at the now demolished
            Rose and the ongoing Bear Garden. In 1613, with another partner, the waterman <rs
              ref="eats:152268" type="Person_Commoner">Jacob Meade</rs> who had been working at the
            Bear Garden since the late '90s, he conceived of a multi-purpose entertainment centre
            with a removeable stage, that could mount weekly plays, <rs ref="eats:21767"
              type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">animal baitings</rs> (at least bi-weekly), and other
            types of amusement such as <rs ref="eats:204281" type="Entertainment_Type"
              >‘flytings,’</rs> in which contestants hurled scurrilous verse at each other. Some

            construction of the <rs ref="eats:227893" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Hope</rs> have
            survived to show us that Henslowe had in mind a playhouse to rival in size and beauty,
            not the Globe, but rather the Swan, which seems to have ceased long since as a
            competitive operation.<note type="foot">Transcriptions of DC: Mun 49 and 51, will be

          <p>Bernard Beckerman first analyzed the gradual evolution of Henslowe's role in theatrical

            final assessment can be quoted: 'Historically Henslowe represented the manager of the
            future at an early stage of development. Yet his ability to function as a manager or
            producer was blocked by the structure of the acting company. In fact, the two could not
            co-exist. Shared responsibility among working actors not only followed different
            procedures of decision-making but had no room for managerial guidance. The company
            needed financing but not control and, in fact, resisted control by a single individual
            ... .'<note type="foot">Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' pp 59–60.</note> Beckerman suggested that
            four periods can be identified in the growth of Henslowe's role as a proto-theatre
              manager.<note type="foot">Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' p 28. Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's
                Opposites</title>, pp 82–3, seems to accept Beckerman's identification of the four
              phases, while noting that the diary does not always reveal which role, whether as
              landlord or banker, Henslowe was assuming when he made his account entries.</note></p>
          <p>In the first phase at the Rose (up to 1596–7), Henslowe was acting primarily as a
            landlord, with less direct involvement in the company's operations. The second, 'late
            Rose-early Fortune,' period, ran from mid-1596 to early 1604, a time when playing
            companies were challenged by increasing efforts by the authorities in London and on the
            privy council to control the number of playhouses and their operation, while they also
            faced more competition and plague closures. Henslowe seems to have attempted greater
            involvement as banker with lord admiral's men during this period, offering loans to the
            company during seasons of declining performance income at the Rose or at court (for
            example, 1596–7, when they were not invited). Carson's review of evidence in the diary
            for these years notes an extension of involvement in company affairs: 'Beginning in the
            Spring-Summer season of 1598, Henslowe seems to have provided most of the money spent on
            playbooks, costumes, and properties by Admiral's Men.'<note type="foot">
              <title>Companion</title>, pp 24–30, especially 27.</note> For the first time, he is
            also on record posting bonds for two actors who had defected to join <rs
              ref="eats:199956" type="Collective_Troupe">Pembroke's men</rs> in 1597 at the rival
            Swan playhouse, as well as for two others seeking to join lord admiral's men at the Rose

            July 1597. <note type="foot">See further below 'History of the Playhouse.'</note>. If,
            as may be the case, Langley had initiated the idea of requiring actors to sign bonds
            with him before playing at the Swan, Henslowe was to follow his example in adopting this
            deeper involvement in the affairs of the lord admiral's men. Entries in the diary show
            that he required the disaffected actors recruited from Pembroke's men, as well as
            others, totalling ten altogether, to guarantee that they would play only at the Rose for
            stated terms ranging from one to three years.<note type="foot">Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' pp
              36–42, outlines the details of the loans to the company and the players' bonds
              established by Langley and Henslowe during these years. See also Foakes,
                <title>Diary</title>, pp 238–41, for the bonds for Richard Jones, Robert Shaa,

            approach was happening in 1597, Alleyn retired from the stage, leaving Henslowe to
            manage relations with the company more directly. However, despite their apparent
            dependency on periodic financial loans, the evidence suggests that he was unable to
            assert substantial control of the management of the lord admiral's men who repaid their
            debts whenever they could. 'It would appear that the landlord was satisfied to lend
            money to the players in order to keep them at his theatre, where he earned a more than
            satisfactory income from rent.'<note type="foot">Carson, <title>Companion</title>, p 27.
              A more recent review of the evidence for Henslowe's evolving management style at the
              Rose has been done by Mao, 'Rose Playhouse,' pp 146–59.</note> In other words, the
            gain was stability for the playhouse operation rather than control of the company's
            productions while in residence there.<note type="foot">The goal of 'stability' was
              recognized by Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' p 43.</note></p>
          <p>The third period highlights Henslowe's management of the Bear Garden, in partnership
            with Alleyn until 1610. The fourth and final phase Beckerman termed the 'Hope period,'
            beginning in 1611 when the new company of Lady Elizabeth's men first signed articles of
            agreement with Henslowe.<note type="foot">See further Siobhan Keenan, <title>Acting

              referred to in a bond signed by actors of the company on 29 August 1611 (see further

              citing DC: Mun 47 as 'Almost identical.')</note> Almost two decades after the opening
            of the Rose, Henslowe's management style had evolved so that he was more forceful in his
            dealings with Lady Elizabeth's men. When he and Jacob Meade launched work on the Hope
            playhouse on Bankside in 1613, they were making plans for Lady Elizabeth's men to be
            resident. Articles of Agreement drawn up with the actor <rs ref="eats:204862"

          <p>When Henslowe died on 6 January 1615/16, he was a man of wealth and property, drawing
            income from numerous rentals, various court appointments, and successful business
            ventures that centred on entertainment, primarily on Bankside. He appears to have kept
            his investments and partnerships under effective control during his lifetime, but once
            dead, the rights to his estate became subject to bitter conflict and interminable court
            cases that will be included in the forthcoming REED edition for the Bear Garden/Hope
            records<!--IN: Link to BG/Hope to be inserted here-->. Was Henslowe really worth the
            £10,000 to £12,000 that his avaricious nephew claimed and clearly wanted a slice of?
            Poor Agnes, who inherited the bulk of the estate, was described in a dispute over the
            will, as ‘aged almost 100 yeares and grown Childishe and very simple.’ Edward Alleyn was
            accused of ‘most cunninglie’ insinuating himself into the process of drawing up a
            version of the will during Henslowe’s final hours.<note type="foot">TNA: C 33/133 A (17
              November 1616), ff 240v–1.</note> For quite a few years a formerly functional family
            and partnerships fell into disarray but it is worth noting that Alleyn, also a man of
            influence and strategy, was well-placed as son-in-law to Agnes Henslowe to inherit much
            of the estate left to her by her husband.</p>

          <p>The <rs ref="eats:157260" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Rose</rs> holds a unique place in

            contemporary record of the repertory of plays performed there as well as the owner’s

            partially excavated in the late twentieth century.</p>
          <p>Henslowe's earliest entries in the diary indicate his likely acquisition of the
            manuscript after his brother John's death in 1591 so details are lacking for the period
            before 19 February 1591/2.<note type="foot">Susan Cerasano, 'Revising Philip Henslowe's
              Biography,' <title>Notes and Queries</title> 32.1 (1985), 67–8.</note> In fact, the
            diary does not have a complete and readily understood accounting of the full run of
            plays performed and profits taken throughout the almost twenty years of theatrical
            activity at the Rose. As Neil Carson noted after his detailed analysis of the contents,
            'It is difficult to imagine how Henslowe could have supervised his various business
            enterprises without a fuller set of books including, at the very least, a ledger in
            which he would have recorded his transactions with individuals. If such books existed,
            possibly they became separated from the diary at the time of Henslowe's death. Whatever
            the truth, we must recognize, I think, that the diary contains only a partial record of
            Henslowe's activities, albeit a record maintained by a reasonably painstaking
            individual.' <note type="foot">See Carson, <title>Companion</title>, p 8 and his summary
              (p 13).</note> It is worth emphasizing that some of the documents in the treasury
            chest, where they were kept in <rs ref="eats:234772" type="Place_F_School">Dulwich</rs>
            after <rs ref="eats:153045" type="Person_Commoner">Alleyn's</rs> acquisition of the
            collection, could have been mislaid or lost much later. When George Warner, Keeper of
            Manuscripts at the British Museum, first examined and catalogued the surviving
            Henslowe-Alleyn papers in the 1880s, he noted that Edmond Malone, who first discovered
            the diary, was allowed to take possession of 'many curious manuscripts relative to the
            stage' which he kept until his death. <note type="foot"> Warner,

          <p>There is no reason to assume that Henslowe did not keep a record, however informal, of
            his playhouse business between the opening of the Rose in 1587 and February 1591/2, but
            that record has not survived so we must piece together from various sources what

          <p>In very brief summary of the archaeological discovery, the developer group Imry
            Merchant acquired the site, intending to demolish the existing 1957 office block named
            Southbridge House before erecting a new building now known as Rose Court. A short-term,
            ten-week archaeological assessment and excavation was required by the Southwark Council
            before construction could commence and was funded by the developer. However, ten weeks
            rapidly turned into six months, as Blatherwick and Pickard explain: 'The totality of the
            survival of those remains plus the unprecedented public response towards the extant
            structure, associated with both William Shakespeare and the development of modern
            English dramatic tradition, had a major impact on national policy towards archaeological
            remains in England and on public awareness of the potential of urban archaeological
            remains. After negotiations in the late spring of 1989, most of the archaeological
            remains of The Rose were preserved <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> by the introduction of

          <p>Only two-thirds of the site could be excavated at the time, so the eastern side of the
            playhouse remains to discover. What has been uncovered reveals that the original
            structure was a thatched timber-framed polygon consisting of fourteen sides
            approximately 72' in diameter. There were two rings of walls surrounding an open yard,
            with no reliable proof of the exact location of the exterior entrance into the yard,
            although evidence suggests that it would have been at the south end near the main access

              type="Place_F_Street">Maid Lane</rs> See, for example, one of the archaeologists,
            Julian Bowsher, on the subject of a trapdoor: 'The stage surface itself is assumed to
            have been wooden boards, raised well above the yard surface. Within the footprint of the
            stage was a plaster surface that would suggest that there was an under stage area or
            void, which might have provided storage room and access on to the stage proper through a
              trapdoor.'<note type="foot">Julian Bowsher, 'Encounters Between Actors, Audience and

              Andronicus and Trapdoors at the Rose and Newington Butts,' <title>Shakespeare
                Survey</title> 71 (2018), 221–31, has reviewed evidence for a trap door from Q1
              stage directions of Titus Andronicus, as performed at the Rose in 1594. While not
              arguing for a trap in the first phase of the Rose, he proposes that a trap would have
              been essential and available for Titus Andronicus in the post-1591 playhouse. It may
              also be indicative that the entrance door to the playhouse is shown at the south end
              on both versions of John Norden's map (1593 and 1600, see below).</note> The stage,
            tapered in shape, projected out into the north section of the yard between bays 6 and
            10, delimited by the inner wall at the north. Bowsher summarizes its measurements –
            which surprised many scholars at the time – as follows: 'At the front it had three
            edges, a long central one and two tapering shorter sides. It thus had a depth of 5m
            (16ft 5in.) and an estimated maximum width of 11.5m (36ft 9in.) narrowing to 8.2m (26ft
            10in.) at the front, covering an area of about 46.4m (499.45sq ft).... The wooden boards
            of the actual stage would certainly have been raised above the level of the yard,
            perhaps by 1.52m (5ft) as recorded at the Red Lion. The front stage wall at the Rose
            survives to a height of about 0.12m (4 3/4in.) above the yard but flush with the surface
            under the stage. It was therefore a permanent feature, unlike the temporary trestles
            employed at the later Hope....'<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose Theatre</title>,
              39–40. Given the fixed stage, Bowsher, in a later essay, refutes the speculation that
              the Rose might have been first intended to serve as a bearbaiting arena before serving
              as a playhouse, an idea floated by Jon Greenfield and Andrew Gurr in 'The Rose
              Theatre, London: The State of Knowledge and What We Still Need to Know,'
                <title>Antiquity</title> 78 (June 2004), 330–40. See further Bowsher, 'The Rose and
              its Stages,' <title>Shakespeare Survey</title> 60 (2007), 36–48.</note> There was no
            evidence of supporting pillar bases for a roof overhanging the stage or of a projecting
            tiring house: the area between the outer and inner back walls of the stage likely served

            subject to speculation. See, for example, one of the archaeologists, Bowsher, on the
            subject of a trapdoor: 'The stage surface itself is assumed to have been wooden boards,
            raised well above the yard surface. Within the footprint of the stage was a plaster
            surface that would suggest that there was an under stage area or void, which might have
            provided storage room and access on to the stage proper through a trapdoor.'<note

          <p>This building, as partially revealed at its foundation level by archaeologists in 1989,
            was the Rose, built by the carpenter John Griggs in partnership with Philip Henslowe and
            opened sometime before October 1587. At the end of that month the neighbours were
            complaining to the authorities that the privy council order restraining plays on the
            Sabbath was being ignored in the <rs ref="eats:223826" type="Place_PA_Liberty">liberty

            previous letter on 7 May 1587 from the privy council to the Surrey justices of the
            peace, ordering the inhibition of plays during the heat of the summer months, might
            imply the opening of the Rose sooner than has been assumed, but the letter is not

              type="Collective_Troupe">Lord Strange's men</rs> arrived there just as Henslowe began
            using his famous memorandum book. Furthermore, the speculative dating of 1592 or 1593
            has been typically assigned to the petition from Strange's men to the privy council and
            the <rs ref="eats:137174" type="Collective_Occupations">watermen's</rs> companion
            petition to the <rs ref="eats:25845" type="Person_Male">lord admiral</rs> pleading for

              <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 4, p 311, who suggests a date of July 1592
            following the restraint of playing at the Rose from 23 June 1592 after the Feltmakers'
            apprentices' recent riot in Southwark. However, Alan H. Nelson has studied the seventeen
            signatures on the watermen’s petition, discovering from his St Saviour's parish register
            research that two of those signing were dead by 1591.<note type="foot">Nelson has not
              yet published his 2012 conference paper, ‘Philip Henslowe and the Bankside Watermen: A

              50–1.</note> Given that the earlier of the two men's death dates was January 1590/1,
            the previous summer of 1590 therefore becomes a viable date for the petitions and, just
            possibly, the year before.</p>
          <p>Strange's men were a large company performing plays by some of the best in the business
            – Marlowe, Kyd, and Greene among others, and quite likely including a young Shakespeare
            by 1592.<note type="foot">For an in-depth study of the first known company resident at

            watermen,' who benefitted from ferrying the constant traffic across the Thames to the
            theatre. The reference to the players' hope of a command performance before the queen is
            worth remarking on. Some of the most seasoned actors of the day had joined Lord
            Strange's men following the death of their previous patron, the <rs ref="eats:44753"
              type="Person_Male">earl of Leicester</rs>, in September 1588.<note type="foot">For

              formation of their new company, see <title>Lord Strange's Men</title>, pp 30–6.</note>
            During the Christmas and Shrovetide seasons, 1590–90/1, they were to perform twice at
            court, so their anticipation of such a lucrative opportunity, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            1590, was not unfounded. As noted in the previous section, Edward Alleyn, the star actor
            from lord admiral's men, would join them soon, possibly as early as these first court
            performances, so they must have rapidly become a major attraction on Bankside. The
            following year they were invited to perform an unprecedented six plays at court during
            the festive season, so it is likely that they would have continued to prefer residency
            at the Rose the rest of the year rather than touring the provinces.</p>
          <p>At some point during 1591–2, Henslowe renovated his playhouse, perhaps in response to
            the remarkable success of the resident acting company. Early in his diary, ff 4–5v, he
            notes, in itemized detail, 'such carges as I haue layd owt a bowte my playe howsse in
            the year of or lord 1592.'<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>,

              type="foot">Carson, <title>Companion</title>, pp 14–15.</note> The 1989 archaeological
            excavation of the site revealed some of these structural renovations made to the
            playhouse with the assistance of the original builder, John Griggs. The alterations were
            focused on rebuilding the northern end of the site to allow for an increase in audience
            capacity and improved staging conditions. The stage was newly constructed: as Bowsher
            describes, it was '...built 2.1m (6ft 10 1/2in.) farther north than the original. It had
            a depth of 5.6m (18ft 4in.) and it is estimated to have been 8.4m (27ft 7in.) long,
            although its front length was not fully uncovered by our excavation. This would have
            provided a complete stage area of about 50.5m<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (543.58sq
            ft).... Although its dimensions were not much larger than those of the first stage, it
            was slightly more rectangular and gave the impression of a greater "thrust" because of
            the extension of the yard on each side of it.'<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose
                Theatre</title>, pp 48–50. See also Bowsher, 'Twenty Years On: The Archaeology of
              Shakespeare's London Playhouses,' <title>Shakespeare</title>, 7.4 (2011), 461–2, who
              describes this as the archaeologists' most important discovery. While the shape of the
              stage may have remained largely unchanged, 'Hitherto the actors were largely acting in
              one, forward, direction. With the extra space at the sides of the second Rose stage
              acting had to be in three directions.' The result would have benefitted the actors as
              the improvement provided 'a greater scope for interaction with the audience.</note>
            Surviving evidence of pillars close to the front corners of the stage suggests that a
            roof for full stage cover was provided for the first time, thereby necessitating the
            widening outward of the galleries to the east and west to preserve sight lines. The yard
            was thus substantially expanded by an estimated thirty-nine per cent 'to cover about
              163m<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (1754 1/2sq ft)'.<note type="foot">Bowsher,
                <title>Rose Theatre</title>, p 51.</note> It was barely raked, in contrast to the
            incline of the first, and the original mortar was replaced with a mix of compacted
            earth, cinder, and cracked hazelnut shells.<note type="foot">Full details of the second
              phase of the building discovered during the archaeological excavation in 1989 are

              with photographs of the site and an architectural drawing, fig 50.</note> Henslowe's
            own renovation notes on f 5v of the diary indicate the addition of a 'penthowwse shed'
            added at the tiring house door behind the stage, but no trace was found of its
            construction or precise site during the excavation. He also refers for the first time to
            a lords' room and its ceiling but the location of this special seating area was not
            revealed either.<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, p 13;

          <p>As the diary confirms, <!-- IN: Maybe link to events here at a later date?--> in 1592–3
            Lord Strange's men performed at Henslowe's Rose, with an extended run from 19
            February–22 June 1592, and another from 29 December 1592–1 February 1592/3. It seems
            improbable that they would have mounted their plays during the period of reconstruction
            of the north end of the playhouse, so the February/March 1591/2 dates of Henslowe's
            'carges' would seem to favour Neil Carson's assessment that the receipts were probably
            submitted some time after the work was completed. <note type="foot">Carson,

            on 22 June. On 23 June the privy council ordered the closure of playhouses in London and
            the suburbs until Michaelmas, out of concern for the potential of further unrest and

          <p>During this period of plague and uncertainty for acting companies and playhouse owners,
            Edward Alleyn seems to have joined the reformed lord admiral’s men. No surprise,
            perhaps, that Henslowe's son-in-law and partner Alleyn, who was also the lead actor of
            the company, would accept Henslowe's offer to make their base at the Rose. Between 14
            May 1594 and 13 July 1600 the lord admiral's men began a long-term engagement at the
            Rose that was broken only by periodic interventions by the privy council when plague
            fears resurfaced, by required closures during Lent, or by very occasional disruptive
              events.<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, pp 21–35, and

            tours in the provinces but their preference was clearly for London and the court where
            they were invited to perform annually fourteen times before 1600 (with the sole
            exception of 1596–7).<note type="foot">For performances at court, see Gurr, 'Appendix
              4,' <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, p 293.</note></p>
          <p>The first interruption in the new arrangement between Henslowe and the re-formed lord
            admiral's men seems to have occurred between 17 May and 14 June. From 3–13 June both the
            lord admiral's men and the recently formed lord chamberlain's men moved to the old <rs
              ref="eats:227741" type="Place_F_Playhouse">playhouse at Newington Butts</rs>, less
            conveniently located a mile to the south and soon to be closed.
            <!--IN: Link to Newington Butts collection to be inserted at a later date?--> Laurie
            Johnson has recently done an in-depth study of this relatively unknown and little
            documented playhouse and its brief glory days when two famous Elizabethan companies
            brought their talents to its stage. He proposes that extreme weather and flooding on the
            marshy Bankside during the 1594 'year of floods' must have caused Henslowe's move to
            negotiate rental of an alternative space with the Newington Butts owner, <rs
              ref="eats:133645" type="Person_Commoner">Peter Hunningborne</rs>: 'I suggest the
            ongoing rain and spates of high waters took their toll on Henslowe's Bankside venue,
            forcing him to consider viable alternatives, and Newington's indoor venue on high ground
            would seem to have been just that.'<note type="foot">Johnson, <title>Shakespeare's Lost
                Playhouse</title>, pp 143–4. See further pp 136–7 and 140–5. MacLean's small edition
              of dramatic records for Newington Butts will be forthcoming in the REED series.</note>
            Whether the two companies performed the seven plays mounted there together (some more
            than once) or alternated remains the subject of ongoing debate as Henslowe groups his
            entries together under a common heading and the exact number and membership of the
            companies during this era of formation are not known.<note type="foot">See, for example,
              Greg, <title>Diary</title>, vol 2, pt 2 pp 85–6, and more recently, Johnson,

          <p>When the lord admiral's men returned to the Rose on 15 June, they settled in for a long
            residency, their almost daily performances for the following year disrupted only by
            performances at court on 28 December and 1 and 6 January.<note type="foot">They ended
              their first run on 26 June 1595: see Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, p 30.
              For a succinct chart of performance dates and related payments for the Rose,
              1594–1600, the 'Chronological Abstract of the Diary in so far as it Relates to
              Dramatic Affairs' provided by Greg, <title>Diary</title>, vol 2, pp 328–32, remains
              useful and is not repeated here. Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp
              141–3, 159–60, also summarizes the dates of opening and closing at the Rose, as
              witnessed, not always consistently, by Henslowe.</note> In fact, Henslowe's accounting
            practices between 15 June 1594 and 5 November 1597 allow a relatively reliable view of
            the repertory schedule at the Rose before he shifts to a notably different style of
            record. Gurr has traced the membership, performances, repertory practices, and play
            texts during the company's sojourn at the Rose in detail in his study of the company in
              <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, to which the reader is referred. Earlier
            studies of the company and its career at the Rose include Chambers' summary in
              <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 139–73, and Greg's earlier edition of
              <title>Henslowe's Diary</title> with extensive commentary and tables of reference in
            volume 2.</p>
          <p>Wiggins and Richardson, British Drama 1533-1642, vols 2-4, account for 173 plays, with
            a further eight possibly performed by or written for the lord admiral's men as recorded,
            primarily in Henslowe's diary or in the Stationers' Register, up to the summer of 1600.
            Of this remarkable repertory only twenty-one have survived (with two fragmentary), in
            print or in manuscript.<note type="foot">See further Appendix 3 for an inventory of

          <p>In 1595, the Rose was closed for most of Lent, but this was also when Henslowe recorded

            carpentry. In June the same year he also paid for making a throne in the 'heavens.'<note

          <p>In fact, playing resumed at the Rose (but not the Swan) on 11 October 1597. As Wickham
            notes, the lord admiral’s men would have been preparing for performances at court during
            the Christmas season, and as they enjoyed the patronage of an influential member of the
            privy council, the need to rehearse well in advance would have facilitated their return
            to the stage in the autumn.<note type="foot">Wickham, 'Privy Council Order,' pp

          <p>In July 1598, a further, apparently futile, appeal to the privy council was made by
            members of the St Saviour's vestry, requesting that the local playhouses cease
            performances because of their 'enormyties.'<note type="foot">See <ptr

            on Bankside the following year when the Globe opened on the south side of Maid Lane, not
            far from the Rose. This playhouse, too, is shown on Norden's 1600 inset map. Much has
            been made in times past of the competition that would thereby ensue between the lord
            admiral's men and the chamberlain's men newly relocated from the <rs ref="eats:228217"
              type="Place_F_Playhouse">Theatre</rs> to the Globe in 1599. Did Henslowe respond
            by laying plans to move his enterprise in retreat to the north of the city where the <rs
              ref="eats:63599" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Fortune playhouse</rs> would open in the
            autumn of 1600? Roslyn Knutson has argued persuasively against a narrative inherited
            from Chambers that when Henslowe changed his style of accounting towards the end of 1597
            to record more loans to the company and partial payments to playwrights it must mean
            that the lord admiral's men fell on hard times and 'lived from hand to mouth, and had
            acquired the thriftless habit of sharing their profits weekly or even daily, and keeping
            no reserve fund.'<note type="foot">See 'The Commercial Significance of the Payments for

              vol 2, p 162, for the unjustified depiction of the playwrights as 'extremely
              out-at-elbows men of letters who hung about the Rose' and 'occasionally found it
              profitable to take their "earnest" for a play, and then to find plausible reasons for
              indefinitely delaying its completion.'</note> Instead, when focusing on the 'crucial
            year' of 1599–1600, 'which has the highest incidence of partial payments in the diary,'
            Knutson does a close analysis of the accounts and concludes as follows: 'I suggest that
            over the years of 1597–1603 the Admiral's men maintained a large repertory of new and
            old plays on a variety of popular subjects and in a variety of dramatic kinds; that in
            1599–1600 they increased the number of works-in-progress that they usually financed in
            order to acquire an even larger, newer, and more diversified set of offerings; that in
            1600–1, they eased the burden of expenses by continuing plays already in repertory and
            by reviving a few old favorities; that in 1601–2 they increased the number of revivals,
            which not only were relatively inexpensive to produce but also served as a showcase for
            Alleyn's return to the stage.'<note type="foot">Knutson, ‘Commercial Significance,’ p
              131. An earlier article by Neil Carson, 'Production Finance at the Rose Theatre,
              1596–98,' <title>Theatre Research International</title> 4 (1979), 172–83, also
              questioned the dominant narrative, pointing out through close analysis of various
              sources of evidence between 1596–8 that the diary does not consistently record all
              expenses and income and so cannot be relied upon as a comprehensive witness to
              playhouse operations.</note>
          </p>
          <p>The probability that Henslowe and Alleyn together had conceived of a strategic move to
            the north side of the Thames before the Theatre was dismantled and the Globe opened on
            Bankside has been discussed in the previous section, where links to the relevant records
            in this collection can be found. The January 1599/1600 warrant from the <rs ref="eats:25845"
              type="Person_Male">lord admiral</rs> in support of the new playhouse, in
            particular, refers to 'the dangerous decaye of that Howse'<note type="foot">See <ptr

            an accurate reflection of the Rose's condition or simply designed to make a persuasive
            case for the move of the lord admiral's men to the desired new location could be
            debated. However, the privy council picked up the theme in support of Alleyn's building
            project in their 8 April order, followed by an order on 22 June legislating only two
            playhouses for operation in the London area – the Fortune in the north and the Globe in
            the south. Burbage's Theatre had already been pulled down but the venerable <rs

          <p>It is evident that despite the notional 'decay' of the Rose and official attempts to
            reduce the number of playhouses on Bankside, Henslowe continued to maintain its
            operation regardless of the loss of the lord admiral's men to the fair new Fortune that
            he and Alleyn had opened in 1600. The diary's accounts during this period are quite
            sporadic for the Rose and there is no consistent evidence of residency by a single
            company. On a new folio Henslowe begins to record performances by Pembroke's men, but
            only two entries are made for 28–9 October.<note type="foot">See Foakes,

          <p>1603 was a year of national crisis. The aging queen's illness raised anxieties early in
            the year. The privy council's order of 19 March for the restraint of stage plays until

            have been suspended in deference until after that date. Henslowe noted the suspension of

          <p>Other historical sources indicate that the plague raging in London would have kept the
            playhouses closed until after Lent 1604, and even then the rest of that year was likely
            to have been disrupted by fresh outbreaks.<note type="foot">The original privy council
              registers for 1601/2–13 were destroyed by fire in 1618. However, Barroll,
                <title>Politics, Plague, and Shakespeare’s Theater</title>, pp 104–23, provides a
              detailed outline from other historic sources of the likely impact of the 1603–4 plague
              on Shakespeare's company, the <rs ref="eats:25345" type="Collective_Troupe">king's
                men</rs>, then resident at the Globe, but all London area playhouses would have felt
              the economic consequences.</note> Given these circumstances we might ask whether
            operations ceased at the Rose entirely by May 1603, with the onset of plague in London,
            Henslowe's other involvements at the Fortune and the Bear Garden, as well as practical
            concerns for the age and looming cost of improving and maintaining the Rose playhouse as
            of Michaelmas 1605 when the original lease on the Little Rose would expire. As outlined
            in the first section above, the Sewer Commission reports for 1605–6 indicate that
            Henslowe abandoned the lease and the playhouse; the archaeological analysis of the
            remains in 1989 appear to confirm that it was dismantled around the same time.<note

            <p> From the reference here to the 'playe howse now in framinge,' it is apparent that

                type="Place_F_Playhouse">playhouse</rs> foundations had been started before 10
              January 1586/7. It is equally clear from the description of the 'smalle
                ten<ex>emen</ex>te or dwellinge howsse scittuate and standinge at the sowthe ende'
              of the property that <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130879/"
                type="Person_Commoner">John Cholmley</rs> already held a lease on <rs
                ref="eats:229110" type="Place_F_Residence">that tenement</rs>, which was to become a
              potentially lucrative victualling house for the playhouse. His small building is shown
              on John Norden's maps of 1593 and 1600 in the southwest corner of the Little Rose
              site. For more on the late twentieth-century excavation of the site and Cholmley's
              house, see Bowsher and Miller, <title>Rose and the Globe</title>, pp 24–32, 111.</p>

            <p> This order was never carried out and may not have been related to the performance of
                <title>The Isle of Dogs</title> during the same summer, as some have assumed; see
              William Ingram, 'The Closing of the Theaters in 1597: A Dissenting View,'
                <title>Modern Philology</title> 69.2 (November 1971), 105–15. Glynne Wickham, while
              subscribing to the view that the order should be seen in the context of the
                <title>Isle of Dogs</title> production, has pointed out that the intention of the
              order was essentially a restraint of public performances in London for three months
              only rather than outright suppression of all theatres. In fact playing resumed at the <rs

                ref="eats:227779" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Swan</rs>) in October and November
              1597. As he notes, the <rs ref="eats:127834" type="Collective_Troupe"

              both enjoyed the patronage of members of the <rs ref="eats:351822" type="Collective_Office">privy council</rs>, so rehearsing for a royal
              audience would have facilitated their return to those two public stages in the autumn.

              more details on each, see Appendix 3 and Wiggins and Richardson, <title>British
                Drama</title>, vols 2–4. Very few of those named survive. Wiggins and Richardson's
              titles have been followed for each in the textual notes.</p>

            <p>Carson, <title>Companion</title>, pp 49–50, notes several puzzles presented by this
              document: 'Not the least of these is the identity of the author. The phrase "I have
              bought" sounds suspiciously like Henslowe, and if indeed he is the compiler of the
              list then the words probably mean no more than "have lent the actors to buy". The fact
              that one of the plays on the list <title>Vayvode</title>, belonged to <rs

                >Edward Alleyn</rs> in January 1598/9 raises the possibility that he may have been
              the "I" in question' (p 49). Carson further outlines other anomalies, such as omission
              on the list of playbooks of some plays known from the diary to have been staged or
              purchased in the same period. Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, p 103,
              favours Henslowe as the compiler of the list of plays owned by the company, but with
              the exclusion of those still owned by Alleyn.</p>

                >Admiral's Men</rs> had moved from the <rs ref="eats:157260" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Rose</rs> to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/63599/"
                type="Place_F_Playhouse">Fortune</rs>. Furthermore, the astrological symbol for
              Mars indicates that 4 March fell on a Tuesday, as it did in 1599/1600 but not 1600/1
              (with thanks to Alan H. Nelson for this note and his revision of the date). Rowse,
                <title>Simon Forman</title>, p 15, dated the entry as 4 March but both Cerasano,
              'Philip Henslowe, Simon Forman,' p 158, and Lupi&#x0107;, 'Early Performances,' p 99,
              n 5, misread the date as 9 March.</p>

            <p> However, as Lupi&#x0107; points out, the entry for 15 March 1599/1600 indicates that
              Cerasano, p 158, misdates Forman's attendance at the performance of <title>Sir John
                Oldcastle</title> in the following comment: 'On 16 October 1600, in the final
              performances of the Lord Admiral's Men at the Rose, Forman attended <title>Sir John
                Oldcastle</title>, although it is unclear whether Forman saw Part 1 or Part 2 of the
              play.' Lupi&#x0107;, p 99, points out that on '12 March Henslowe made a payment to the
              tailor for his work relating to the production of <title>The Second Part of Sir John
                Oldcastle</title>. Four days later Forman saw <title>Sir John Oldcastle</title>, and
              given the closeness of these dates the most plausible interpretation is that the play
              Forman saw was indeed the freshly mounted second part.' In any case Forman's primary
              purpose in noting the performance was to record the address of a woman he was
              interested in pursuing for other reasons.</p>

              type="Collective_Occupation">fishmonger</rs>, and it seems clear that she intended to
            bequeath the property in perpetuity to the charitable uses of her parish. But an ancient
            statute, the Statute of Mortmain,<note type="foot">Properly called the statute 'de
              Religiosis,' enacted by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/205235/"
                type="Person_Royalty">Edward I</rs>’s parliament in 1279. See Great Britain,
                <title>The Statutes of the Realm</title>, vol 1 (London, 1810; rpt 1963), 51.</note>
            erected barriers to such an intention. If one wished to leave property to the Church –
            and leaving it to a parish meant leaving it to the Church – one could not do that
            directly because the Statute of Mortmain prohibited it.</p>
          <p>'Mortmain' is the term commonly used to describe property held in perpetuity by any
            entity, but most commonly by the Church. Because the entity never dies such property is
            exempt from inheritance, with its attendant taxes and death duties. Property held in
            mortmain thus represented a lost revenue stream to the Crown, and Edward I hoped to end
            the practice with his statute. But his statute addressed only Church property, and
            clever persons soon realized that property could be held in perpetuity by trustees, or
              feoffees<note type="foot">Feoffee: A person invested with a freehold estate in land,
              that is, with a fief or fee, the freehold estate conveyed by livery of seisin.</note>,
            as easily as by the Church.<note type="foot"> This was, or was perceived to be, a fairly
              large concern. According to the anonymous eighteenth century author of a letter to
              William Pitt, 'one third of the land of this kingdom is vested in mortmain'
                (<title>Three Letters to the Right Hon. Wm. Pitt, on the Subject of the Statutes of
                Mortmain: Containing an Enquiry into the Origin and Present State of the Possessions
                of the Clergy under that Tenure</title> (London, 1795), 2).</note></p>
          <p>So on 3 December 1552 Thomasyn Symonds conveyed to eighteen named persons, whom she
            described in the deed of transfer as her 'feoffees,' the 'mesuage or ten<ex>emen</ex>t
            called the little Roose with two gardeyns to the same adioyning.' The property was
            devised to 'my said feoffes aforenamed &amp; their heires foreu<ex>er</ex>.' And on 22
            December 1552, only three weeks after the enrolling of this deed of gift, Thomasyn’s
            attorney <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/205304/"
              type="Person_Commoner">Peter Baker</rs> affirmed that he had taken 'full &amp;
            peaseble possession state &amp; season' of the Little Rose property and that he 'did
            giue &amp; deliu<ex>er</ex> the same peasible possession state &amp; season to theise
              p<ex>er</ex>sons hereafter named being the most p<ex>ar</ex>t of the feoffes' named in
            the deed.<note type="foot"> Baker’s affidavit is enrolled with the deed (TNA: C.54/482,
              mb 13).</note></p>
          <p>The documents tell us that some of the feoffees, perhaps the bulk of them, were
            parishioners of St Mildred's, some of them perhaps <rs
              ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/"
              type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens"> churchwardens</rs>. But the records of the
            parish do not survive from before the middle of the seventeenth century, so there is no
            way to resolve this issue. All we know is that these eighteen men were charged to use
            the income from the property to perform certain charitable acts. Should those charitable
            acts align with the desires of the parish of St Mildred, so much the better.</p>
          <p>The feoffees’ initial use of the Little Rose property was to lease it to tenants and
            collect the rent. In 1574 the feoffees leased the property for thirty-one years (or
            until 1605) to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129508/"
              type="Person_Commoner">William Griffen</rs>, for £7 per year, and Griffen soon sold
            the lease to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126687/"
              type="Person_Commoner">Robert Withens</rs>, who in turn sold the lease, in 1584/5, to
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129736/" type="Person_Commoner"
              >Philip Henslowe</rs>, who – with twenty years left on the lease – built <rs
              ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/157260/" type="Place_F_Playhouse"> a
              playhouse</rs> on the property, and continued to pay the annual rent of £7 per year.
            It seemed clear to Henslowe that the rent he paid went to the parish of St Mildred,
            though he must have paid it to the feoffees or their agents as specified in the
              deed.<note type="foot"> 'Pd vnto St mildred<ex>es</ex> – vij li': Foakes and Rickert,

            the actual was perhaps not uncommon in the period. When the lease expired in 1605,
            Henslowe declined to renew it, perhaps because the new rent would rise to £20 per year,
            plus 100 marks for upkeep.<note type="foot">A '<rs

                <p>The meaning of ‘highnoyous’ is not entirely clear, though the bequest for 'the
                  reparacions of highnoyous wayes abowte London' and its repetition further down as
                  'amending of highnoyous wayes' suggests that 'highnoyous wayes' should be
                  understood as one phrase, and that highways were intended. Bequests for mending of
                  highways were not uncommon in the period; see, for example, the section on
                  ‘Charitable Donations to Infrastructure’ in Susan E. James, <title>Women’s Voices
                    in Tudor Wills, 1485–1603: Authority, Influence and Material Culture</title>
                  (London and New York, 2016), 55–8, or B. Kirkman Gray, <title>A History of English
                    Philanthropy, from the Dissolution of the Monasteries to the Taking of the First
                    Census</title> (London, 1905), 20–1, for numerous instances. The vestry of the
                  parish of St Saviour appointed each year two of its members to be surveyors of
                  highways and collections were taken regularly for mending and repairing the
                  highways of the parish. Shakespeare knew it happened; in <title>The Merchant of
                    Venice</title>, Graziano says ‘Why, this is like the mending of highways / In
                  summer where the ways are fair enough!’ (<title>The Oxford Shakespeare: The
                    Complete Works</title>, Stanley Wells et al (eds), 2nd ed (Oxford, 2005),
                  5.1.263–4. But the word is peculiar and its repetition in the will suggests it was
                  not a scribal error.</p>

        <head>Inventory of Plays Performed at the Rose</head>
        <div>

          <p>This inventory of plays associated with the Rose Playhouse includes several at the end
            listed as only possibly performed there. Wiggins and Richardson's annotated catalogue
              <title>British Drama 1533–1642</title>, vols 2–4, serves as authority for the title,
            authors, troupes, genre and status listed below. Further details of date, plot, roles,
            staging, sources, performance history, and more for each play are provided –– as far as
            possible –– in that source, according to a numbering system provided here, by volume.
            See also Wiggins' 'Introduction,' vol 1, for the scope and limitations, content, format
            and arrangement of the catalogue.</p>

          <p>Others have published their own inventories of plays performed at the Rose, with
            predictable variations in the titles and in their interpretation of Henslowe's diary
            records. See for example, Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 118–27,
            143–7, 165–71, Rhodes, 'Appendix A,' <title>Henslowe’s Rose</title>, pp 185–223, and
            Scott McMillin who narrows his focus to published and manuscript plays that can be
            securely identified with the Rose, <title>The Elizabethan Theatre and <title>The Book of
                Sir Thomas More</title></title> (Ithaca and London, 1987), 115–24. For the Admiral's
            Men in particular, see Andrew Gurr, who accounts for 158 plays at the Rose in total,
            with twenty–four surviving in print and two in manuscript, 'Appendix 1,'
              <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, pp 201–53, and Roslyn Knutson, 'Commercial
            Significance,' 'Appendix I: Plays in <title>Henslowe's Diary Eligible for
              Production</title>, 1597–1603,' pp 134–47.</p>

          <p>The sheer number of lost plays listed below reveals how difficult it is to assess any
            individual company preferences for tragedies and histories over, for example, comedies,
            in their repertory. The ongoing collaborative work of contributors to the <ref target="https://lostplays.folger.edu"><title>Lost
              Plays Database</title></ref> is a further valuable
            contribution to repertory studies.</p>
