                the Infecc<ex>i</ex>on of the Plague doeth much increase in and about London and it

                keepers of Paris Garden bee hereby commanded and required forthw<ex>i</ex>th to shut

                boards, and they (ie, the dogs) are those which we use in Venice in bull-baitings.
                They also have in another house many bears, and in another some wild bulls, and in
                the middle is a circular space surrounded by stands with their awnings/covers for
                the rain and for the sun, where every Sunday in the training of these dogs one takes
                great entertainment/pastime, paying a penny to stand below (which is s.2) and two to
                go up into the stands. The sport runs from the vesper hour until the evening; and
                there they put on very fine baitings. First they lead into this space, which is
                closed about, and one cannot leave it if they do not open certain gates, they bring
                in, I say, a horse of little value with all its trappings, and a monkey in the
                saddle, then four, or six of the younger dogs, with which they make an attack, and
                (then) they change them, bringing in other more experienced ones, in which baiting
                it is splendid to see the horse flee, kicking its hooves, and biting, and to see the

                death of the horse, it is removed (from the arena, and) there they bring in some
                bears, now one at a time, and then several together, but this baiting is not very
                fine to watch. Finally they then bring in a wild bull, and they tie it with a rope
                about two paces long to a stake fixed in the middle, and this baiting is finer to
                watch than the others, and with more danger for the dogs than the others, many of
                which are wounded and die, and it lasts until evening<gap reason="omitted"/></ab>

            <p> Dawson explains Magno's valuation of the English penny in Italian terms as follows:
              'Magno here (as elsewhere in the MS) uses a symbol impossible to reproduce which
              appears to stand for <hi rend="italic">soldi di piccoli</hi>. The <hi rend="italic"
                >denaro</hi>, which was not a specific Italian coin, he equates here with the penny
              (as Florio also does in <title>Queen Anna's cw World of Words</title>, 1611) and
              explains it, apparently, as equivalent to two <title>soldi di piccoli</title>. The
              penny in the 1560's contained .48 grams of pure silver, and two <title>soldi di
                piccoli</title> were equivalent to about .5 grams' ('Bull-Baiting,' p 98, n 1). </p>

            <p> The endorsement on the indenture citing a case brought by George Hunt and his wife
              Elizabeth (daughter of Thomas and Margery Warram) against George Ireland and John
              Maulthowse is likely to be TNA: REQ 2/108/5 (1593-4). In their bill George and
              Elizabeth Hunt gave a date of death for William Payne of 25 October 1575 but, in view
              of the April 1575 date of this indenture, this is most likely an error. </p>

            <p> The bill recounts that George Ireland married Margery Warram after the death of
              Thomas Warram, and cites him as a friend of John Malthowse. Joan Payne assigned the
              lease of the Barge, Bell and Cock to Malthowse and John White in August 1582 (see Joan
              Payne's Lease of the Barge, Bell and Cock to John White and John
              Malthouse<!-- #IN link to
BHJPWM -->). Malthowse is named as one of Joan Payne's executors in her will of
              November 1582 (TNA: PROB 11/64/533). </p>

            <p> According to the bill of complaint in a complicated 1583–4 Court of Requests case,
              Edward Bowes v. John Digges and John Gape <!-- #IN to link to BHEBDG -->, Morgan Pope,
              a London goldsmith, assigned the recently acquired sub-lease of the Bear Garden
              property on the Bell and Cock site to Edward Bowes in 1579. Bowes then appointed
              William Glover as his agent to bait bears there. There is another more general entry
              for Bowes' wharf on 9 July (f 122). This is Bowes' earliest appearance in the Sewer
              Commissioners' reports. </p>

            <p> It is worth noting here that Edward Bowes, brother of Ralph Bowes, master of the
              Bears, Bulls and Mastiff Dogs, was recorded several times for bringing the bearbaiting
              game from 'Paris Garden' to the royal court. For payments made between 1580 and 1588

                to haue shaken a rodde towardes them, then to haue touched them. For amongst the

                to put it in some forme of breuitie, that it may be fixed vp in such places as by a
                paper included in your L<ex>ordshi</ex>ps letter, and nowe returned seemeth fitt,
                whereunto I haue added the Barres at Holbern, and that being don by mr Norton I
                praye your L<ex>ordshi</ex>p to cause the officers in the Citie of

                not be a note or marke made in this <del>howse</del> Calander of howses or Chambers
                letten out for lodging aswell as for vitailing in myne opinion I thinke it also
                necessarie that the said places be notefied in the said Calender, and specially for
                such streetes and lanes as leade from the Citie to Westm<ex>inster</ex> I am also
                hartely sorry for the mischance whereof I haue vnderstanding bothe by your

                bayted, yet I think it very conuenient, to haue bothe that and other like prophane
                assemblies prohibited on the Saboth daie, and if it shalbe requisite to haue such
                like worldly pastimes I think some other daie within the weke meeter for those
                purposes, and to that ende I minde to treate w<ex>i</ex>th my L<ex>ordship</ex>s of
                the Counsell, that some good order may be taken for that purpose; wishing
                neuerthelesse that your L<ex>ordshi</ex>p in the meane time, hauing rule of the
                whole Citie might thinke it conuenient to make a generall prohibition within euerie

                  comaundem<ex>en</ex>t shold on the Saboth daie resort to any such prophane
                assemblies or pastimes which I leaue to yo<ex>u</ex>r L<ex>ordshi</ex>ps discretion
                to be considered by the aduise of the aldermen your bretheren. Your other letter of

              <ab>Furthermore, outside the city there are a number of theatres, in which English
                actors perform, almost every day, tragedies and comedies amidst a great crowd of
                people. These are generally concluded with various dances with very agreeable music
                employed, and with the great applause of the people<gap reason="omitted"/> There is
                still another place, also having the form of a theatre, which is intended for the
                baiting (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> hunting) of bulls and bears, who, fastened from
                behind are exceedingly harassed by large dogs and English mastiffs - which in the
                vernacular are called 'Docken' - but so that often those dogs, being seized by the
                teeth or attacked by the horns, by the bears or bulls, are often in mortal danger,
                and even sometimes die. Fresh and keener ones are immediately supplied in the places
                of those that are wounded, or tired.</ab>

              <ab>The whipping of a fully blinded bear sometimes occurs at the end of this
                entertainment, where five or six standing in a circle, fall upon the bear pitiably
                with whips. And, although being tethered he is unable to flee, nevertheless he
                defends himself with spirit. He throws down those standing around who get too close
                unless they rightly and providently watch out for themselves, and he tears the whips
                out of the hands of those who strike (him), and breaks them. At these
                entertainments, and everywhere else they happen to be <pb n="133" type="page"/> the
                English constantly use, in following manner, the plant nicotiana, which in the
                American idiom they call 'tobacco'; others say 'paetum.' They put the said herb,
                which has been dried so that it can easily be made into powder, into a hole at the
                back end of a pipe made for this purpose from clay, and light it by applying a
                flame. Smoke is drawn into the mouth by the front end, and it goes back out through
                the nostrils, as if through a funnel. It brings out with it a great deal of phlegm
                and discharge of the head. In these theatres, moreover, various fruits, such as
                apples, pears and nuts, according to the season, are carried about to be sold, as
                well as wine and ale.</ab>

            <p> As Henslowe reports here, the Admiral's player, Gabriel Spencer (1576-98), was slain
              on 22 September by Ben Jonson in a duel in Hoxton fields. Spencer is known to have
              been with Pembroke's Men in 1596, moving with others from that company to the
              Admiral's Men at the Rose by 1597. See further Andrew Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's
                Opposites: The Admiral's Company 1594-1625</title> (Cambridge, 2009), 287. For
              Jonson, see Ian Donaldson, 'Jonson, Benjamin <del>Ben</del> (1572–1637), poet and

            <p> Ralph Bowes died a few days later. Greg cites as evidence Henry Lok's letter on 8
              June to Sir Robert Cecil (<title>Henslowe Papers</title>, p 97, n 3); TNA: SP 12/267,
              f 71). The subsequent patent for Dorrington's grant of the desirable office of the
              Royal Game of Bears, Bulls and Mastiff Dogs, was made on 11 August 1598 (TNA:
              C66/1485). It is worth noting here that two draft letters patent in the name of
              Elizabeth I (never executed) survive in separate archives for Henslowe and Alleyn,
              presumably drawn up by them in anticipation of gaining the office of master of the
              Bulls, Bears and Mastiff Dogs in 1598. The draft letter patent for Henslowe, dated
              June 1598, survives at Dulwich College (see Ioppolo, <title>Henslowe-Alleyn
                Digitisation Project</title>, MUN 18<!-- 
https://henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/catalogue/muniments-series-1/group-018/01-recto/ -->).
              A transcription was published by Collier, <title>Memoirs</title>, pp 213-15. Alleyn's
              draft letter patent, dated 1598, can be found at TNA: WARD 2/61/241/43. </p>

            <p> Greg suggests that My Lady Edmonds was 'probably the wife of Sir Thomas Edmonds,
              Comptroller of the Household, and the Dorothy Edmonds mentioned as a gentlewoman of
              the privy chamber in 1580' (<title>Henslowe Papers</title>, p 98, n 9; BL: MS
              Lansdowne 29, f 161). Edward Darcy was a groom of the privy chamber from 1583–1603
              (see <title>HPO</title><!-- #IN to link to
https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/darcy-
edward-1543-1612 -->). </p>

            <p> Sir John Dorrington, gentleman pensioner, was knighted at Whitehall on 23 July 1603.
              The grant to him of the office, with a fee of l0d a day and 4d for his deputy, was
              made on 7 August 1598 (see <title>Calendar of State Papers Domestic: Elizabeth,
                1598-1601</title>, Mary Anne Everett Green (ed) (London, 1869), 79). His patent was
              dated 11 August, and was renewed by James I on 14 July 1603 (see Ioppolo,
                <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title>, DC: Mun
              25<!-- #IN to link to https://henslowe-
alleyn.org.uk/catalogue/muniments-series-1/group-025/01-recto/ -->). Arthur Langworth
              was a friend of Henslowe and Alleyn, frequently mentioned in the diary. He was
              evidently in town at this moment while his wife was entertaining the Alleyns in the
              country. Alleyn was still, or again, there when Henslowe sent his subsequent letter of
              26 September (see Ioppolo, <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title>, DC: MS
              I, f <del>2v</del><!-- #IN to link to https://henslowe-
alleyn.org.uk/catalogue/mss-1/article-024/02-verso/ -->). Langworth 'married Rose,
              daughter of Will Durant of Cottesmore, co. Rutland, and died in 1606, the probate of
              his will being dated 6 Nov' (Warner, <title>Catalogue</title>, p 66, n 2.) </p>

            <p> Edward Griffin was a vestryman of St Saviour's in 1609 and a scrivener who acted
              with Henslowe in that capacity, both in the setting up of the Hope playhouse and
              baiting arena and in the quarrel between Henslowe and Robert Dabourne (see Articles of
              Grievance by Players against Philip Henslowe<!-- #IN to link to BHAGPH -->). After
              Henslowe died on 6 January 1615/16, Griffin was one of the appraisers of his estate
              and wrote the inventory, a copy of which he gave to Alleyn; see Chancery Court
              Depositions in the case of John Henslowe v. Agnes Henslowe, Edward Alleyn and Roger

              over sixty years later, questioned Collier's additions: 'It is clear, I think, that

            <p> Philip Rosseter (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1568-1623) was a lutenist and composer who
              became a manager of the Children of the Queen's Revels at Whitefriars by January
              1609/10. As this document indicates, Rosseter's boys' company amalgamated with Lady
              Elizabeth's Men in March 1612/13, although whether the newly merged troupe performed
              at any playhouse other than Whitefriars at this time is only subject for speculation.

                either Freind or Foe or indiferent, all's one, Read, Laugh, like or dislike, all the

                selfe. Yet to shew thee the meaning of this little Building, Imagin this Epistle to
                be the doore, and if thou please come in and see what stuffe the whole Frame is made
                off. Be it therefore knowne vnto all men, that I, Iohn Taylor Waterman, did agree
                with William Fennor, (who Arrogantly and falsely entitles himselfe the Kings
                Maiesties Riming Poet) to Answere me at a triall off Wit, on the seauenth of October
                last 1614 on the Hope stage on the Bank-side, and the said Fennor receiued of me ten
                shillings in earnest of his comming to meete me, whereupon I caused 1000 bills to be
                Printed, and deuulg'd my name 1000 wayes and more, giuing my Freinds and diuers of
                my acquaintance notice of this Bear-garden banquet of daintie Conceits, and when the
                day came that the Play should haue been performed, the house being fill'd with <pb
                  n="A3v" type="signature"/> a great Audience, who had all spent their moneyes
                extraordinarily: then this Companion for an Asse, Ran away &amp; left mee for a
                Foole, amongst thousands of critticall Censurers: where I was ill thought of by my
                freinds, scorned by my foes, and in conclusion, in a greater puzzell then the blinde
                Beare in the midst of all her whip broath; Besides the some of twenty poundes in
                money, I lost my Reputation amongst many, and gaind disgrace in stead of my better
                expectations. In Reuenge of which wrongs done vnto me by the said Ryming Rascal, I
                haue written this Inuectiue against him, cheifly because the ill looking Hound doth
                not confesse he hath iniur'd me, nor hath not so much honesty as to bring or send me
                my money that he tooke for earnest of me: but on the contrary part, he Railes and
                Abuses mee with his callumnious tongue, and scandalizeth me in all Companies where
                he heares me nominated. But in a word, Reader, when thou hast read this that
                followes, I thinke thou wilt Iudge me cleare of the many false Imputations that are
                laid vpon me. So I leaue thee to thy Considerations, and I proceed to my

                bestow a Banquet of Defence; which, I hope, shall rellish with more delight in thy
                generous opinion. I am sorrie that my Penne is pluckt backe from better Occasions,
                to answere an Opposite so ignoble. But seeing my Reputation is shot at by such a
                poysoned Pistoll, I thought it meete to serue out the Bullet of his Infamie with my
                approued Honestie, before it grew ranke, or festered too farre in the Worlds
                Apprehension. But to the purpose: Maister Taylor, the Gentleman-like Sculler at the
                Hope on the Banke-side, at a <pb n="A3 verso" type="signature"/> friends house of
                mine, acquainted me with his Proiect; which was as followeth: That hee the said
                Taylor had studied such seuerall Humors in Prose, as neuer were the like before:
                (which indeede fell out true, to his shame) wherein hee would haue me ioyne; hee to
                play a Scene in Prose, and I to answere him in Verse: Whereto I condiscended, on
                these Conditions; viz. That I might haue halfe the Commoditie thereof; Or Securitie
                for fiue pounds; Or else twentie shillings in hand, and the rest as the Day
                affoorded. Next, That I might heare his Booke read (which was fit) to know on what
                ground I might build my Inuention. And last, That I should see the Manner of his
                Challenge before it was published, and set my Answere to it with my owne hand. To
                all which hee graunted, and deliuered mee fiue Shillings vpon the same: Whereupon I
                promised faithfully, That if all this were on his part performed, I would (God
                willing) meete him, and with my best endeauor striue to giue the Audience content.
                Now, here I must entreat you, before you condemne mee, note but the Occasions of my
                Breach of Promise: This Water-Taylor, with his Confederates, presuming he had bound
                  <pb n="A4" type="signature"/> me with his Earnest-money, printed his
                Challenge-Bill, and my Answere annexed thereunto, without my Hand, Knowledge, or
                Consent: Nay more; My Answere was by him set vp so meane and insufficient to so
                brauing a Challenge, that I altogether disliked thereof (as I had reason) and
                thereupon sent my Man with the Money fiue dayes before the Play, to certifie them,
                That I was otherwise employed, and would not come, in regard of the Wrong done vnto
                mee, in setting vp my Answere without my Consent: My Man deliuered the Message, but
                lost the Money at Play, emboldening himselfe vpon the Wrongs I had receiued; which I
                haue since payed. And the same day I receiued a Letter out of Warwickeshire from my
                Father, That he was not well; wishing mee and my wife to repayre vnto him with all
                possible speede. Now, you that are Parents of Children, or Children to Parents,
                Iudge, whether I ought rather to disobay my Father, or displease Iohn Taylor;
                purchase my Fathers hate, or lose a Scullers loue; and I hope you will say I had
                sufficient cause to keepe me from the Hope. But fearing my homely Truth (though it
                be sufficient to plead my Honestie) is not answerable to your <pb n="A4 verso"
                  type="signature"/> expectation of my Practise in Poesie; I will, as neere as I
                can, fit my Muse to your liking, which is my content: And euer rest honester by Land

            <p> James Archer had been chosen as minister of St Saviour's on 21 March 1613/14; see

            <p> Roger Cole was a notary; he also served as a vestryman and churchwarden of St
              Saviour's and was the bishop of Winchester's registrar (LMA: P92/SAV/450, p 394, 399,
              405: see Nelson and Ingram, <title>Parish of St
              Saviour</title><!-- #IN to link to http://www-

              'Philip Henslowe', p 153; TNA: C 24/431/48).</p>

            <p> William Austen was the son of Lady Joyce Clark. She had a long friendship with
              Alleyn, as did her son. See, for example, Warner, <title>Catalogue</title>, pp
              142-143, 165, 170, 173, 179, 193, 333-4. </p>

            <p> Robert Bromfield served as vestryman and churchwarden at St Saviour's, as did
              Henslowe and Alleyn (see Nelson and Ingram, <title>Parish of St
              Saviour</title><!-- IN to link to
http://www-personal.umich.edu/ingram/StSaviour/vestry-minutes-450.html -->). He was
              connected by marriage to William Austen; see Nelson and Ingram, <title>The Parish of
                St Saviour, Southwark Some Wills of St Saviour Parishioners,
              1558-1650</title><!-- IN to
link to: https://stsaviour.folger.edu/wills/wills-a.html#austenwilliam01 -->. He was
              involved with Alleyn's playing company, the Lord Admiral's Men, from 1601 (Honigman
              and Brock, <title>Playhouse Wills</title>, p 104). He is presumably the 'Mr Bromfeild'
              named in Henslowe's diary and other Henslowe records several times (see Foakes,
                <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, pp 177, 182, 208, 296-298). By 1616 he is cited as
              an examiner in the Star Chamber: see Appendix 4: I. f) and the deposition of James
              Archer in TNA C 24/431/48, ff 2, 8, 21). In 1618 he was among those appointed by
              letters patent from James I in 1618 to determine the boundaries of the Unicorn and
              other disputed properties in St Saviour's parish : see Appendix 4:V. e). By 1621 he
              had become an MP (see <title>HPO</title><!-- IN to link to

            <p> The property bought from from Throckmorton (Throgmorton) by Henslowe and bequeathed
              to his nephew Philip was that of the Great Pike Garden, which he had acquired from
              Sarah and Henry Throgmorton on 1 June 1609. Sarah was the daughter of John Gibbons and
              the Gibbons family had held the Pike Garden since around 1563. The Munson (Munsey)
              rents bequeathed to his sister Mary had also once been in the possesson of the Gibbons
              family before passing to Munson in 1584-5 and then to Henslowe in 1606-7 (TNA: C
              2/JasI/H23/63; see also Greg, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, vol 2, p 31; Braines,

            <p> The Mr Austen mentioned in James Archer's deposition was probably William Austen,

                  pl<ex>ain</ex>t<ex>iff</ex>e further sheweth that Allen the def<ex>endan</ex>t
                marryed Joane the daughter of Agnes, and knowinge or being informed that the said

                write or moue a penn, did offer to guide his hand to write his name, and that the

                Allen did put a pen into his hand, and that Phillip made only a m<ex>ar</ex>ke
                beinge in his life tyme well able to write. And that the def<ex>endan</ex>t Allens

                to guide his hand to write his name nor whether he did offer to put a penn into his

                he being chardged in the bill to sett the p<ex>re</ex>tended will on foote to gaine
                the whole estate to himself./ The pl<ex>ain</ex>t<ex>iff</ex>e likewise by his bill
                setteth forth That although Phillip died on the Saturday night, the

                Sabbaoth day in the morning To w<ex>hi</ex>ch point alsoe I am of <del>opo</del>
                opinion, the def<ex>endan</ex>t<ex>es</ex> ought to haue answered, because the

                was not made unduely and fraudulently by practise and Confederacy in such sorte or
                to any such intent and purpose as in the said Phillipp Hensloe his Answeree is
                pretended Without that that the defend<ex>an</ex>t Will<ex>ia</ex>m Henslowe was
                brother and heire and nearest of blood vnto the said Phillipp Henslowe as in the
                said Willi<ex>a</ex>m Henslowe his Answere is p<ex>re</ex>tended And whereas the
                  defend<ex>an</ex>t Will<ex>ia</ex>m Henslowe pretends that he exhibited a Bill
                vnto his Ma<ex>ies</ex>ties High Co<ex>ur</ex>t of Chancery against the said Mr
                Allen his Ma<ex>ies</ex>ties said Atturney saith that true it is that the said

                  Compl<ex>ain</ex>t against the said Allen into the said Cou<ex>r</ex>t of Chancery
                vnder some pretence of title to the premisses now in question in w<ex>hi</ex>ch said
                  suit<ex>es</ex> the said Mr Allen obteined two gen<ex>er</ex>all dismissions as by

                was directed by notes in writing w<ex>hi</ex>ch were not pursued in the draught of
                the said Will in such sorte as in the Answere of the said Willi<ex>a</ex>m Henslowe
                is pretended ffor his Ma<ex>ies</ex>ties said Atturney saith that the said will was
                directly and orderlye made according to the true meaning of the said
                  Testato<ex>ur</ex> Without that that the note whereby the draught of the said
                Phillipp Henslowes will was directed was in these words after the death of Agnes his
                wife he gave vnto Will<ex>ia</ex>m Henslowe his brother the yeares of the lease of
                the Beare garden and the tenement<ex>es</ex> therevnto adioyning holden of the
                Bushopp of Wincester as in the said Will<ex>ia</ex>m Henslowe his Answere is
                pretended ffor his Ma<ex>ies</ex>ties Atturney saith that the note soe made was and
                is agreeing with the last ‸<add place="above">will</add> and testament of the said
                Phillipp Henslowe as the same is proved and readye to be showen vnder seale and the
                true menc<ex>i</ex>on and meaning of the said testato<ex>ur</ex> was pursued in the
                said will and not wrested to anye other sence but as the testato<ex>ur</ex> did
                expresse and declare the same And his Ma<ex>ies</ex>ties said Atturney further saith
                that in respect the said Phillipp Hensloe his last will and testament was much
                opposed by the said Will<ex>ia</ex>m Henslowe the defendant the same was proved in
                due forme of Lawe by verye sufficient Witnesses And his Ma<ex>ies</ex>ties said
                Atturney doth auerr that the defend<ex>an</ex>t<ex>es</ex> doe Confederate and
                Combine together to defraude ye king<ex>es</ex> Ma<ex>ies</ex>tie of the premisses

                where they lye and the boundes limitt<ex>es</ex> and names thereof and doe publish
                and diuulge new names soe that the same maye not be discerned and knowne from the
                lands of the Bushopp of Winchester and doe entitle the said Bushopp to his

              <ab>James, by the grace of God, king of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
                defender of the faith, etc, (sends) greetings to our beloved Robert Bromfield
                esquire, John Hunt esquire, Lionel Tichborne gentleman, and William Day gentleman.
                Since disputes and disagreements lately arisen have been held and raised in our
                court before the treasurer, chancellor, and barons of our exchequer at Westminster
                between our attorney general, plaintiff on our behalf, and William Henslowe and
                Jacob Meade, defendents, regarding one principal messuage and tenement, or inn,
                lately called the Unicorn, with appurtenances, and all those messuages, cottages,
                curtilages, wharfs, gardens, orchards, and, by our inheritances, with the
                appurtenances formerly in the tenure or possession of John Allen, Robert Mote,
                Robert Johnson, Leonard Willis, John Dancy, Thomas Warren, Thomas Floody, Robert
                Exninge, Peter Hemminge, or of any one or any of their assigns, or any one of them,
                situated, lying, or existing in the parish of St Saviour's in the borough of
                Southwark in our county of Surrey lately of the lands and tenements of Henry
                Polsted, esquire, and exchanged by that very Henry Polsted with Edward VI, formerly
                king of England, in or around the sixth year of his reign, and afterwards by the
                same late Edward VI, king of England by his letters patent regarding the demise
                bearing the date 26 April in said sixth year of his reign granted to the aforesaid
                Henry Polsted for a term of twenty-one years with an annual rent of £32 4s 5d and
                afterwards by the late lady queen, Elizabeth, by her letters patent sealed with her
                great seal of England at Westminster bearing the date of 11 October in the
                thirty-seventh year of her reign granted to a certain Robert Livesey esquire and a
                certain Gerard Gore – with the exception of a tenement and parcel of land now or
                lately called 'the Queen's pike garden,' a parcel thereafter reserved to the same
                late queen - for a term of fifty years, at that time to come, for an annual rent of
                £27 14s 10d. With these things having been granted and because it is not yet
                apparent to our said court where and in which place or in which places our aforesaid
                lands and tenements lie and exist, you should know for that reason that we, trusting
                greatly in your faith, industry, and provident circumspection in the conduct of our
                business, assign you and give to you, to four, three, and two of you full power and
                authority, and we entrust you, four or three or two of you, by the presents, both by
                your viewing and perambulation of either three of you or two of you and by the
                examinations and depositions of any trustworthy witnesses and by all other ways,
                means, and measures by which you might better know or be able, or three or two of
                you might know or be able, to inquire where and in what place or in what places the
                aforesaid land and our tenements lie and exist and (where) the same (are) separable
                by limits and boundaries from other lands both of the aforesaid defendants and from
                any others lying contiguous to the same which are to be divided and bounded so that
                perfect knowledge of the same and of each of the same parcels may be known
                thereafter, and also diligently to examine any witnesses regarding and concerning
                any of the articles or interrogatories to be exhibited or weighed touching the
                premises both on our behalf and on the part of the aforesaid defendants. And
                therefore we command you that, on a day and at a place of this kind, or on days and
                at places, which you will have arranged or three or two of you will have arranged
                for this purpose, you attend to the premisses or three or two of you attend, and
                that you do and execute, or that three or two of you do and execute, all and each of
                those things with the effect in the aforesaid form so that you have, or two or more
                of you have, both the examinations and depositions of the aforesaid witnesses as
                well as all the rest done by you or by two or more of you to be delivered before the
                barons of our Exchequer at Westminster as quickly as you are able, and at the latest
                within fifteen days after the day of St Michael under you seals, or (the seals) of
                three or of two of you, together with this our commission. We also give to you, or
                to three or two of you, full power and authority by the presents to call before you,
                or three or two of you, any persons whom you see to be especially suitable for
                attestation of the truth in the premises and diligently to examine (them) on their
                oaths which are to be taken, the holy gospels of God having first been touched
                corporally by them before you, or two or more of you, on and regarding the premises.
                Lest this our earlier command should remain further to be executed, we grant,
                moreover, to all and singular our mayors, sheriffs, bailiffs, constables, and other
                officers, ministers and underlings, whomever they may be, by the tenor of the
                presents firmly in command that to you and to each one of you in the execution of
                the premises should obey, comply with, and heed just as is proper at the peril of
                the incumbent, with the proviso always that the aforesaid defendants should have
                forewarning of a length of forty days regarding the day and place of the execution
                of the presents. In witness of which matter, we have made these our letters to be
                patent with Lawrence Tanfield, knight, as witness at Westminster on 25 June in the
                twenty-sixth year of our reign of England, France, and Ireland, the fifty-first of
                Scotland by the memorandum roll concerning the same year (of the reign) of this
                king, of the commissions of the city, and by the roll of letters patent. And by
                order of the court, etc. And by the barons.</ab>

              by 104, that is, for 1004. The signatures are therefore more reliable. Stowe's account
              of the burning of the Globe in 1613 immediately precedes this section. The Globe burnt
              down on 29 June 1613, so the burning of the Fortune is placed here around or after
              1617 ('four years after'); it was, in fact, December 1621. </p>

          <p>Leslie Hotson provides a more detailed outline, with documentary evidence, for the
            continuation of the game at the Bear Garden under Thomas Godfrey's management beyond the
            closing of the public playhouses by order of parliament in 1642 ('Bear Gardens and
            Bear-Baiting,' pp 276–88) . Only a select number of post-1642 records are included in
            this appendix, starting with the earliest, published in 1643, a complaint by London
            actors that only plays were singled out for prohibition rather than other entertainments
            like bearbaiting.</p>
          <lb/>
          <p><title>The Actors Remonstrance</title> is followed next by a parliamentary survey of
            the bishop of Winchester's lands in the liberty of the Clink made in 1647 and showing
            Thomas Godfrey still in residence at the Bear Garden. Winchester Palace had been turned
            into a prison after 1642 and the Clink liberty itself was sold to Thomas Walker of
            Southwark in 1649. The survey includes a reference and valuation of the Bear Garden
            property, one of the tenements then sub-leased by Thomas Godfrey. See further

          <p>Life as deputy keeper and tenant of the Bear Garden was not easy for Thomas Godfrey, as
            his Chancery Court pleading in 1652 reveals. In 1642 Thomas Davies, one of the masters
            of the Bears, Bulls and Mastiff Dogs, attempted to suppress Godfrey's bearbaiting
            enterprise and withdraw the lease of the Bear Garden. The subsequent order of the
            council of state, on 55 May 1653, to suppress bearbaiting and prize fencing marks the
            begin of the end for the Bear Garden, which was demolished by February 1655/6<note

                Masters estates upon us and our Harlots in Tavernes; we have cleane and quite given

                Gentlemen of Stave and Taile, namely, boystrous Butchers, cutting Coblers,
                hard-handed Masons, and the like, rioting companions, resorting thither with as much
                freedome as formerly, ma-<pb/>king with their sweat and crowding, a farre worse
                stinck than the ill formed Beasts they persecute with their dogs and whips,
                Pick-pockets, which in an age are not heard of in any of our Houses, repairing
                thither, and other disturbers of the publike peace, which dare not be seen in our
                civill and well-governed Theatres, where none use to come but the best of the
                Nobility and Gentry; and though some have taxed our Houses unjustly for being the
                receptacles of Harlots, the exchanges where they meet and make their bargaines with
                their franck chapmen of the Country and City, yet we may justly excuse our selves of
                either knowledge or consent in these lewd practices, we having no propheticke soules
                to know womens honesty by instinct, nor commission to examine them; and if we had,
                worthy were these wretches of Bridewell, that out of their owne mouthes would
                convince themselves of lasciviousnesse: Puppit-plays, which are not so much valuable
                as the very musique betweene each Act at ours, are still up with uncontrolled
                allowance, witnesse the famous motion of Bell and the Dragon, so frequently visited
                at Holbourne-bridge; these passed Christmas Holidayes, whither Citizens of all sorts
                repaire with far more detriment to themselves then ever did to Playes, Comedies and
                Tragedies being the lively representations of mens actions, in which, vice is
                alwayes sharply glanced at, and punished, and vertue rewarded and encouraged; the
                most exact and naturall eloquence of our English language expressed and daily
                amplified; and yet for all this, we suffer, and are inforced, our selves and our
                dependants, to tender our complaint in dolefull manner to you great Phoebus, and you
                inspired Heliconian Virgins: First, our House-keepers, that grew wealthy by our
                endevours, complaine that they are enforced to pay the grand Land-lords rents,
                during this long Vacation, out of their former gettings; in stead of ten, twenty,
                nay, thirty shillings shares, which used nightly to adorne and comfort with their
                harmonious musique, their large and well-stuffed pockets, they have shares in
                nothing<pb/> with us now but our mis-fortunes; living meerly out of the stock, out
                of the interest and principall of their former gotten moneyes, which daily is
                exhausted by the maintenance of themselves and families.</ab>

              <ab type="indent">For our selves, such as were sharers, are so impoverished, that were
                it not for some slender helps afforded us in this time of calamitie, by our former
                providence, we might be enforced to act our Tragedies: our Hired-men are disperst,
                some turned Souldiers and Trumpetters, others destin'd to meaner courses, or
                depending upon us, whom in courtesie wee cannot see want, for old acquaintance
                sakes. Their friends, young Gentlemen, that used to feast and frolick with them at
                Tavernes, having either quitted the kin in these times of distraction, or their
                money having quitted them, they are ashamed to look upon their old expensive
                friends. Nay, their verie Mistresses, those Buxsome and Bountifull Lasses, that
                usually were enamoured on the persons of the younger sort of Actors, for the good
                cloaths they wore upon the stage, beleeving them really to be the persons they did
                only represent, and quite out of sorts themselves, and so disabled for supplying
                their poore friends necessities. Our Fooles, who had wont to allure and excite
                laughter with their very countenances, at their first appearance on the stage (hard
                shifts are better than none) are enforced, some of them at least to maintaine
                themselves, by vertue of their bables. Our boyes, ere wee shall have libertie to act
                againe, will be growne out of use like crackt organ-pipes, and have faces as old as
                our flags.</ab>

              <ab type="indent">Nay, our very Doore-keepers, men and women, most grievously
                complaine, that by this cessation they are robbed of the priviledge of stealing from
                of us with licence: they cannot now, as in King Agamemnons dayes, seeme to scratch
                their heads where they itch not, and drop shillings and half Crowne-pieces in at
                their collars. Our Musicke that was held so delectable and precious, that they
                scorned to come to a Taverne under twentie shillings salary for two houres, now<pb/>
                wander with their Instruments under their cloaks, I meane such as have any, into all
                houses of good fellowship, saluting every roome where there is company, with Will
                you have any musike Gentlemen? For our Tire-men, and others that belonged formerly
                to our ward-robe, with the rest, they are out of service: our stock of cloaths, such
                as are not in tribulation for the generall use, being a sacrifice to moths. The
                Tobacco- men, that used to walk up and downe, selling for a penny pipe, that which
                was not worth twelve-pence an horse-load; Being now bound under Tapsters in Inns and
                Tippling houses. Nay such a terrible distresse and dissolution hath befallen us, and
                all those that had dependance on the stage, that it hath quite unmade our hopes of
                future recoverie. For some of our ablest ordinarie Poets, in stead of their annuall
                stipends and beneficiall second-dayes, being for meere necessitie compelled to get a
                living by writing contemptible penny-pamphlets in which they have not so much as
                poetical licence to use any attribute of their profession; but that of Quid libet
                audendi? and faining miraculous stories, and relations of unheard of battels. Nay,
                it is to be feared, that shortly some of them; (if they have not been enforced to do
                it already) will be encited to enter themselves into Martin Parkers societie, and
                write ballads. And what a shame this is, great Phoebus, and you sacred Sisters; for
                your owne Priests thus to be degraded of their ancient dignities. Be your selves
                righteous Judges, when those who formerly have sung with such elegance the acts of
                Kings and Potentates, charming like Orpheus the dull and brutish multitude, scarce a
                degree above stones and forrests into admiration, though not into understanding with
                their divine raptures, shall be by that tyrant Necessitie reduced to such abject
                exigents, wandring like grand children of old Erra Paters, those learned
                Almanack-makers, without any Mæcenas to cherish their loftie conceptions,
                prostituted by the mis-fortune of our silence, to inexplicable miseries, having no
                heavenly Castalian Sack to actuate and informe their spirits almost<pb/> confounded
                with stupiditie and coldnesse, by their frequent drinking (and glad too they gan get
                it) of fulsome Ale, and hereticall Beere, as their usuall beverage.</ab>

              <ab type="indent">To conclude, this our humble complaint great Phoebus, and you nine
                sacred Sisters, the Patronesses of Wit, and Protectresses of us poore disrespected
                Comedians, if for the present, by your powerfull intercessions we may be re-invested
                in our former Houses, and setled in our former Calling, we shall for the future
                promise, never to admit into our six-penny-roomes those unwholesome inticing
                Harlots, that sit there meerely to be taken up by Prentizes or Lawyers Clerks; nor
                any female of what degree soever, except they come lawfully with their husbands, or
                neere allies: the abuses in Tobacco shall be reformed, none vended, not so much as
                in three-penny galleries, unlesse of the pure Spanish leafe. For ribaldry, or any
                such paltry stuffe, as may scandall the pious, and provoke the wicked to loosenesse,
                we will utterly expell it with the bawdy and ungracious Poets, the authors to the
                  Antiodes.<note type="foot">Antiodes: <hi rend="italic">for</hi> Antipodes</note>
                Finally, we shall hereafter so demeane our selves as none shall esteeme us of the
                ungodly, or have cause to repine at our action or interludes: we will not entertaine
                any Comedian that shall speake his part in a tone, as if hee did it in derision of
                some of the pious, but reforme all our disorders, and amend all our amisses, so
                prosper us Phoebus and the nine Muses, and be propitious to this our complaint</ab>
