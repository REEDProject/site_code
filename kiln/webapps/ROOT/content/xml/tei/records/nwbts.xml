            <p> An oblong tear on the left side of the manuscript has obscured some letters before
              the legible signatures. The first damaged signature may have been by Ralph Sadler,
              identified in the Acts of the Privy Council for the meeting on 15 November as present
              (see <title>Acts of the Privy Council</title>, vol 8, pp 301–26, <title>British
                History Online</title><!-- https://www.british-history.ac.uk/acts-privy-
council/vol8/pp301-325 -->, accessed 23 July 2024). William Bray has identified, in
              the 19th-c. ink below, the signature of Nicholas Bacon, who appears to have signed
              with the initials 'C s' for 'C<ex>ustos</ex> s<ex>igili</ex>' (keeper of the seal).
              There is also an oblong tear in the manuscript where the seal was ripped off,
              obliterating the word before 'ffrendes' and the 'Ar' of Arundell, but possibly more
              letters for Henry Fitzalan (1512–80), twenty-fourth earl of Arundel.</p>

            <p> Besides the earl of Arundel, the privy councillors signing the letter are as
              follows: Sir Nicholas Bacon (1510–79), lord keeper of the Great Seal, 1558–79; Sir
              William Cecil (1520/21–98), first Baron Burghley, lord treasurer, 1572–98; Edward
              Clinton (1512–85), sixteenth earl of Lincoln, lord admiral, 1559–85; Ambrose Dudley
                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1530–90), twenty-first earl of Warwick; Sir Francis
              Knollys (1511/12–96), treasurer of the Household, 1570–96; Sir James Croft (<hi
                rend="italic">c</hi> 1518–90), comptroller of the Household, 1570–90; Sir Thomas
              Smith (1513–77), secretary of State, 1572–7; Robert Dudley (1532/3–88), fourteenth
              earl of Leicester; and Sir Francis Walsingham (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1532–90),
              principal secretary, 1573–90. </p>

            <p> John Hilles' property apparently lay to the south of the 'common sewer,' which ran
              between them on the south edge of Savage's lot (Ingram <title>Business of

            <p> The last recorded performance at court by the earl of Warwick's players was 1
              January 1579/80 (for lxvj s. viij d., TNA: E351/542, f 8), but it is possible that the
              company was still in residence at Newington Butts in May of the same year. Ingram,
                <title>Business of Playing</title>, pp 174–5, and Johnson, <title>Shakespeare's Lost
                Playhouse</title>, pp 89, 99, have speculated that the newly formed earl of Oxford's
              players, led by the Dutton brothers, may have used the playhouse next. How long Jerome
              Savage continued his tenancy is unclear, but by June 1582 Peter Hunningborne is on
              record in the Cathedral Chapter Act Book with a lease for the 'resydue of the
                garden<gap reason="omitted"/>and ground<ex>es</ex> adioyning to the play house'
              <!-- #IN link to NBCCAB -->, indicating the existence of an even earlier lease.</p>

            <p> Savage had moved by 1582 to the parish of St Peter Westcheap, London, where he was
              assessed on £3 3s of goods in a lay subsidy roll for that year (TNA: E179/251/16, f
              79). The baptism of Anne, one of his four daughters, was recorded on 19 March 1581/2
              in the St Peter Westcheap parish register (LMA: P69/PET4/A/001/MS06502). Suzan,
              another daughter, was baptized 28 November 1585, but no baptismal dates have been
              found for Elizabeth, Faith, or Daniel, all named in their father's will. Although the
              surname Savage does not appear in St Peter Westcheap Churchwardens' Accounts between
              1577-83, there is mention of a 'Mr Savage' under the Wood Street subheading in the
              receipts for 1583–4 (LMA: P69/PET4/B/006/MS00645/001, f 112). By November 1586 he was
              still resident there (TNA: E115/343/52, single sheet). He died soon after: his will is
              dated 31 January 1586/7, with a probate date of 18 February (see TNA: PROB
              11/70/119).</p>

            <p> The 'late order' refers to a plague order issued by the privy council to the JPs of
              Middlesex on 17 April 1580, to restrain plays on the outskirts of London until
              Michaelmas (TNA: PC2/12, p 812).</p>

            <p> Privy councillors listed as present at this meeting (p 10) were Sir Thomas Bromley
                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1530–87), lord chancellor, 1579-87; Sir William Cecil

        <head>Inventory of Plays Performed at Newington Butts</head>
        <div>
          <p> This inventory of plays associated with the playhouse at Newington includes only those
            on record. For plays performed at court by the Earl of Warwick's Men, 1575–80, see the
            History of the Playhouse. </p>
          <p> I have followed the annotated catalogue British Drama 1533–1642, vols 2–3, edited by
            Martin Wiggins and Catherine Richardson, as my authority for the title, authors,
            troupes, genre and status listed below. Further details of date, plot, roles, staging,
            sources, performance history and more for each play are provided – as far as possible –
            in that source, according to a numbering system provided here, by volume. See also
            Wiggins' 'Introduction,' vol 1, for the scope and limitations, content, format and
            arrangement of the catalogue. </p>
          <p> Others have published their own inventories of plays performed at the Newington, with
            predictable variations in the titles included and in the interpretation of Henslowe's
            diary records. See for example, Chambers, Elizabethan Stage, vol 2, pp 118–27, 143–7,
            165–71; Johnson, Shakespeare's Lost Playhouse, pp 124–204. For Admiral's Men in
            particular, see Gurr, 'Appendix 1,' Shakespeare's Opposites, pp 201–53. </p>
          <p> The ongoing collaborative work of contributors to the Lost Plays Database,
            https://lostplays.folger.edu, is a further valuable contribution to repertory studies. </p>
