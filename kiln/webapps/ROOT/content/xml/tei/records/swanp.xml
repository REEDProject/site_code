              <ab>There are four amphitheatres in London of evident beauty, which acquire their
                various names from (their) various signs. In them a different performance is shown
                daily to the people. The two more exceptional of these, named the Rose and the Swan
                from (their) hanging signs, are situated south of the Thames. The other two are in
                the north, outside the city, on the street which is accessed by the bishop's gate,
                called 'Bishopsgate' in the vernacular. There is also a fifth but of a different
                structure intended for the fighting of animals, in which many bears, bulls, and dogs
                of stupendous size are raised in separate cages and enclosures, (and) are reserved
                for the fight, providing the most delightful spectacle for people. The most
                outstanding, however, and the largest of all the theatres is the one whose sign is
                the swan â€“ in the vernacular 'the theatre of the swan' â€“ for it seats 3000 people.
                It is built from heaped flint stone â€“ of which there is a great abundance in Britain
                â€“ and is supported by wooden pillars which by their painted marble colour, can
                deceive the most discerning. Since its form seems to express the shadow of a Roman
                work, I have made a drawing above<gap reason="omitted"/>.</ab>

            <p> The two playhouses outside the city boundaries north of the river were the Theatre
              and the Curtain. The splendour and generous dimensions of the Swan were later emulated
              by Philip Henslowe when his second playhouse, the Hope, was built on Bankside in 1613
              (see Gilbert Katherens' contract with Henslowe and Jacob Meade for rebuilding the Bear
              Garden,<!-- #link to Hovland and MacLean, <title>Bear
Garden/Hope Playhouse</title> -->). A sketch of the Swan's interior based on an
              original drawing made by the Dutch visitor, Johannes de Witt (1583â€“96), also survives
              in the recipient's commonplace book, f 132, showing a thrust stage with tiring house
              and lords' room above in an open yard with three galleries, for which see the
              manuscript image attached to this record. </p>

            <p> This order was never carried out and may not have been related to the performance of
                <title>The Isle of Dogs</title> during the same summer as some have assumed; see
              Ingram, 'Closing of the Theaters,' pp 105â€“15. Glynne Wickham, while subscribing to the
              view that the order should be seen in the context of the <title>Isle of Dogs</title>
              production, has pointed out that the intention of the order was essentially a
              restraint of public performances in London for three months only, rather than outright
              suppression of all theatres. In fact, playing resumed at the Curtain and the Rose (but
              not the Swan) in October and November 1597. As he notes, the Chamberlain's and
              Admiral's Men were preparing for performances at Court during the Christmas season and
              both enjoyed the patronage of members of the privy council, so rehearsing for a royal
              audience would have facilitated their return to those two public stages in the autumn.

              playhouse there, the Swan, which must have increased the traffic of playgoers across
              the Thames to the area (for further details and illustrations, see the
              Introduction<!-- #add link -->). Jacob Meade (1557-1624) was a waterman, resident in
              the Clink liberty and Henslowe's partner in the later Hope/Bear Garden enterprise. It
              seems possible from this entry in the vestry minutes that he may have had an
              association with Henslowe for the Rose as well as the Bear Garden by 1598, around the
              time when he was appointed keeper of the Royal Game of Bears, Bulls, and Mastiff Dogs
              (see further Warner, <title>Catalogue</title>, p 234). Meade first appears in 1597 as
              a resident of Rose Alley in the Clink in the St Saviour Token
              Books<!-- # insert link to http://tokenbooks.folger.edu/s
earch/snapshot.php?booknumber=246&amp;entrynumber=31906 -->. The playhouses concerned
              here and below are Langley's Swan in Paris Garden manor and Henslowe's Rose in the
              Clink liberty, both within the parish boundaries of St Saviour's. </p>

            <p> <rs ref="eats:164899" type="Person_Male">John Chamberlain's</rs> amusing account of events at the Swan in a letter to <rs
                ref="eats:427349" type="Person_Male">Dudley Carleton</rs> on 19 November (TNA:
              SP12/285) reveals that Vennar was unable to pull off this ambitious one-day production
              â€“ and indeed probably never intended to, despite the broadside promotion of its plot.
              However, the play was finally staged in 1615 at another theatre, with William Fennor
              among the actors. <rs ref="eats:221802" type="Person_Male">John Taylor</rs>, <title>A Cast over the Water</title> (1615), sig B5v,
              includes Fennor's poorly received performance in a mocking reference to the play:
              'Indeed, thou set'st the people in a rage<pb/> In playing Englands Ioy, that euery
              Man<pb/> Did iudge it worse then that was done at Swan.<pb/> I neuer saw poore fellow
              so behist,<pb/> T'applaud thee, few or none lent halfe a fist...' Taylor (sig C3) goes
              on to mention Fennor's swindling of 'poore old Vennor, that plaine dealing man,<pb/>
              Who acted Englands Ioy first at the Swan,' perhaps a tongue in cheek salute to
              Vennor's own dubious 'plain dealing.'</p>

            <p> There is also an undated poem by 'R.V.' (Richard Vennar) called <title>Englands
                Ioy</title> (<title>STC</title>: 24636.3), celebrating the same victory against the
              Irish rebels led by Tyrone and their Spanish allies under Don Juan de Aguila. Baron
              Mountjoy's victory at Kensale took place on 24 December 1601, so the poem may have
              been published around the same time that Vennar announced his play. </p>

              last, he did not so speedily kill Iohn Dun, with a thrust in the eie, but he was as
              soone murthered afterwards, with a shotte of a Pistoll; for neither of them, after
              they had their deaths wound, spake one word; loe by this you may see, that some hawkes
              are but a flight, and horses are killed with a tournie, and a man is but a shotte; but
              now, by reason that Maister Turner, by his vnluckie hand, thrust out two or three
              eies, and because none others are knowne to doe the like, it hath therefore bred an
              admiration in the ignorant and vulgare sort, insomuch, that generally they doe
              applaude him with this commendation, saying that hee hath not left the like behinde
              him, nor neuer will be the like againe: But this is a great errour in thinking so, and
              farre deceiued are they; for I well know Maister Turner by familair acquaintance, and
              therefore (to speake the right) he was a worthy fellow and deserued well, but yet I
              know many which can goe neare the eie as euer he could doe, if they so listed, as in

              any mans eies, if those which learne them doe carry enuious mindes, or if they were
              desirous to worke a man such a mischiefe, but God forbid that any man should be so ill
              minded, I will not say, but that by chaunce such a thing may be done, and so it may

              (1602)<!-- #link to SWPPEJ -->, Vennar announced its performance at the Swan on 6
              November 1602. According to Vennar's account years later in 1614, he was only able to
              deliver six lines of the prologue on stage, before bailiffs appeared to arrest him for
              debt. Although he pocketed 'much mony,' the authorities did not indict him (Vennar,
                <title>Apology</title>, p 27). The play was finally mounted by William Fennor in the
              spring of 1615, another performance mocked by John Taylor in <title>A Cast Over

        <head>Paris Garden Manor Property Records</head>
        <div>
          <p>On 24 May 1589, Francis Langley acquired by deed the lordship and manor of Paris Garden, paying Â£850 for the property. 
          Thomas Cure the Younger would convey the property and manor house before the feast of the Nativity of St John the Baptist 
          that same year. See further the Introduction: History of the Property<!-- #link to Introduction -->.</p>
        <lb/>
          <p>On 1 December 1601 Hugh and his son Thomas Browker assumed the lease of the manor of Paris Garden from Francis and Jane 
          Langley. For a more detailed account of the desperate financial circumstances and context for Langley's sale of the lease, 
          see further Ingram, <title>London Life</title>, pp 250â€“67. Ingram, p 322, notes that the final step in the transfer of 
            ownership from Langley to Browker concluded on 3 February 1602 (Feet of Fines, CP 25(2)/228/44ELIZIHIL, mb 4; see also 
            Ingram, p 322 n 26). My special thanks to Patrick Gregory, REED Associate Editor and Latinist, for his transcription and translation of this lease.</p>
        <lb/>
          <p>This undated document from the seventeenth century is titled â€˜Lands Concealed and to be obteyned of the Kings Ma{ies}tie.â€™ 
            The lands had formerly belonged to the Knights Templar, but on suppression of the order, the manor was granted to the Knights 
            Hospitaller. In 1536 it was surrendered to the Crown. The date <hi rend="italic">c</hi> March 1606 has been assigned by a much later handwritten 
            note and has been accepted by some others (for example, Herbert Berry, 'The Swan,' (Berry <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, <title>English Professional 
              Theatre</title>, pp 439, 448). However, the St Saviour's Token Books list an Alexander Welch living near the playhouse for only 
            three years, between 1627â€“9, so the early dating to 1606 should be questioned. See Ingram and Nelson, <ref
            target="https://tokenbooks.folger.edu"><title>Token Books</title></ref>, the 1627 entry for Alexander Welch. 
            Further, it is known that others were living in the manor house in the period when the Swan was occasionally used following the death of 
            Francis Langley. Alexander Walsh (Welch) would therefore seem an unlikely candidate for management of the playhouse in the early 
            seventeenth century. See further the Introduction: History of the Property<!-- #link to Introduction -->.

        <head>Inventory of Plays Possibly Performed at the Swan Playhouse</head>
        <div>
          <p> This inventory of plays mostly consists of those only possibly associated with the Swan Playhouse. Wiggins and Richardson' annotated catalogue <title>British Drama 1533â€“1642</title>, vols 2â€“4, serves as authority for the title, authors, troupes, genre and status listed below. Further details of date, plot, roles, staging, sources, performance history, and more for each play are provided â€“â€“ as far as possible â€“â€“ in that source, according to a numbering system provided here, by volume. See also Wiggins' 'Introduction,' vol 1, for the scope and limitations, content, format and arrangement of the catalogue.! 
          </p>
          <p> The number of lost plays listed below reveals how difficult it is to assess any individual company preferences for tragedies and histories over, for example, comedies, in their repertory. The ongoing collaborative work of contributors to the <title>Lost Plays Database</title> (https://lostplays.folger.edu) is a further valuable contribution to repertory studies.</p>
