              <ab>There are four amphitheatres in London of evident beauty, which acquire their
                various names from (their) various signs. In them a different performance is shown
                daily to the people. The two more exceptional of these, named the Rose and the Swan
                from (their) hanging signs, are situated south of the Thames. The other two are in
                the north, outside the city, on the street which is accessed by the bishop's gate,
                called 'Bishopsgate' in the vernacular. There is also a fifth but of a different
                structure intended for the fighting of animals, in which many bears, bulls, and dogs
                of stupendous size are raised in separate cages and enclosures, (and) are reserved
                for the fight, providing the most delightful spectacle for people. The most
                outstanding, however, and the largest of all the theatres is the one whose sign is
                the swan – in the vernacular 'the theatre of the swan' – for it seats 3000 people.
                It is built from heaped flint stone – of which there is a great abundance in Britain
                – and is supported by wooden pillars which by their painted marble colour, can
                deceive the most discerning. Since its form seems to express the shadow of a Roman
                work, I have made a drawing above<gap reason="omitted"/>.</ab>

            <p> This order was never carried out and may not have been related to the performance of
                <title>The Isle of Dogs</title> during the same summer as some have assumed; see
              Ingram, 'Closing of the Theaters,' pp 105–15. Glynne Wickham, while subscribing to the
              view that the order should be seen in the context of the <title>Isle of Dogs</title>
              production, has pointed out that the intention of the order was essentially a
              restraint of public performances in London for three months only, rather than outright
              suppression of all theatres. In fact, playing resumed at the Curtain and the Rose (but
              not the Swan) in October and November 1597. As he notes, the Chamberlain's and
              Admiral's Men were preparing for performances at Court during the Christmas season and
              both enjoyed the patronage of members of the privy council, so rehearsing for a royal
              audience would have facilitated their return to those two public stages in the autumn.

              Theatres,' <title>The Elizabethan Theatre: Papers given at the International

            <p> In 1589 Francis Langley had acquired the lordship of the manor of Paris Garden, west
              along Bankside in the parish of St Saviour, Southwark. By 1595 he had opened a new
              playhouse there, the Swan, which must have increased the traffic of playgoers across
              the Thames to the area (for further details and illustrations, see the
              Introduction<!-- #add link -->). Jacob Meade (1557-1624) was a waterman, resident in
              the Clink liberty and Henslowe's partner in the later Hope/Bear Garden enterprise. It
              seems possible from this entry in the vestry minutes that he may have had an
              association with Henslowe for the Rose as well as the Bear Garden by 1598, around the
              time when he was appointed keeper of the Royal Game of Bears, Bulls, and Mastiff Dogs
              (see further Warner, <title>Catalogue</title>, p 234). Meade first appears in 1597 as
              a resident of Rose Alley in the Clink in the <ref target="https://tokenbooks.folger.edu/search/BookTranscription.php?BookNumber=246">St Saviour Token
              Books</ref>. The playhouses concerned
              here and below are Langley's Swan in Paris Garden manor and Henslowe's Rose in the
              Clink liberty, both within the parish boundaries of St Saviour's. </p>

              SP12/285) reveals that <rs ref="eats:492247" type="Person_Male">Vennar</rs> was unable to pull off this ambitious one-day production
              – and indeed probably never intended to, despite the broadside promotion of its plot.
              However, the <rs ref="eats:492314" type="Drama_TitledWork">play</rs> was finally staged in 1615 at another theatre, with <rs ref="eats:343300" type="Person_Male">William Fennor</rs>
              among the actors. <rs ref="eats:221802" type="Person_Male">John Taylor</rs>, <title>A Cast over the Water</title> (1615), sig B5v,
              includes Fennor's poorly received performance in a mocking reference to the play:
              'Indeed, thou set'st the people in a rage<pb/> In playing Englands Ioy, that euery
              Man<pb/> Did iudge it worse then that was done at Swan.<pb/> I neuer saw poore fellow
              so behist,<pb/> T'applaud thee, few or none lent halfe a fist...' Taylor (sig C3) goes
              on to mention Fennor's swindling of 'poore old Vennor, that plaine dealing man,<pb/>
              Who acted Englands Ioy first at the Swan,' perhaps a tongue in cheek salute to
              Vennor's own dubious 'plain dealing.'</p>

            <p> There is also an undated poem by 'R.V.' (Richard Vennar) called <title>Englands
                Ioy</title> (<title>STC</title>: 24636.3), celebrating the same victory against the
              Irish rebels led by Tyrone and their Spanish allies under Don Juan de Aguila. Baron
              Mountjoy's victory at Kensale took place on 24 December 1601, so the poem may have
              been published around the same time that Vennar announced his play. </p>

              their ends; and first, to beginne with that one of maister Turner, which should be the
              last, he did not so speedily kill Iohn Dun, with a thrust in the eie, but he was as
              soone murthered afterwards, with a shotte of a Pistoll; for neither of them, after
              they had their deaths wound, spake one word; loe by this you may see, that some hawkes
              are but a flight, and horses are killed with a tournie, and a man is but a shotte; but
              now, by reason that Maister Turner, by his vnluckie hand, thrust out two or three
              eies, and because none others are knowne to doe the like, it hath therefore bred an
              admiration in the ignorant and vulgare sort, insomuch, that generally they doe
              applaude him with this commendation, saying that hee hath not left the like behinde
              him, nor neuer will be the like againe: But this is a great errour in thinking so, and
              farre deceiued are they; for I well know Maister Turner by familair acquaintance, and
              therefore (to speake the right) he was a worthy fellow and deserued well, but yet I
              know many which can goe neare the eie as euer he could doe, if they so listed, as in

              any mans eies, if those which learne them doe carry enuious mindes, or if they were
              desirous to worke a man such a mischiefe, but God forbid that any man should be so ill
              minded, I will not say, but that by chaunce such a thing may be done, and so it may

                downe his hat to stop the sight of his charity, wherefore I concluded to make a
                friend of Mammon, and to giue them sound for words, both being but aire, for which
                they should giue double payment, to the intent onely, men of ability might make the
                purchase without repentance, and my selfe obserue that wise rule of Phylosophy; Non
                fiat per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora:<note type="foot">Non … pauciora: <hi
                    rend="italic">'Let it not be done with many things what can be done with

                I was doubly prouided, for Fox and Hare.</ab>

              <ab>The report of Gentlemen and Gentlewomens actions, being indeed the flagge to our
                Theater, was not meerely falcification, for I had diuers Chorus to bee spoken by men
                of good birth, Schollers by profession; protesting that the businesse was meerely
                abused, by the comming of some Beagles vpon mee, that were none of the intended
                Kennell, I meane Baylifes, who seizing mee before the first entrance, spoke an
                Epilogue instead of a Prologue, this changed the play into the hunting of the Fox;
                which, that the world may know for a verity, I heere promise the next Tearme, with
                the true history of my <pb/> life, to bee publiquely presented, to insert in place
                of Musicke, for the actes, all those intendments prepared for that daies
                entertainement: Which, seeing it must rest in your beliefes till then, I will bee
                content so long to weare your Apellation, preferring onely in this Imputation, so
                farre the part of an Apologist, that drawing the accident it selfe, without defence,
                into iudicious question, this Scoggins Crow, that hath filled so many mouths will
                proue but a Rooke. For suppose that the play was hist, was I the first Poet made my
                Clients penitents, let the burning pestle bee heard in my cause, which rang so
                dismally in your eares, and yet the Writer in state of Grace. <pb/></ab>

              <ab>The difference was, I presented you with a Dumbe Show, and the <rs ref="eats:8782" type="Entertainer_Type">Players</rs> say, that
                is alwaies as good as a bad act, neither could the cost bee great, that for one
                twelue pence, afforded mirth for a Twelue-month after: At the highest rate, you lent
                mee but an after-noones hearing, the expectation being worth the money: since
                Phylosophers say, that the sweetnesse of hope is beyond the enjoying, and in this
                sense, I bettered that daies trauell, the errour being your owne, that being
                ignorant of a Logitian, stile mee an Impostor, from which I am so farre, that the
                Law shall speake for mee, whch presupposeth euery man good, till hee bee conuicted
                bad; And I presume it came not within the <pb/> compasse of an inditement: The
                conclusion is this, I had too many Patrons for so slender a worke, and for that
                fault, this Apologie is my sufficient answere. Neither is it strange to haue so much
                mony for six verses, since Bonum quo communius eo melius.<note type="foot">Bonum …
                  melius: <hi rend="italic">'the more common a good thing is the better'</hi></note>
                And Poetry in a more legitimate age, hath beene held cosin-germane to goodnesse, but
                were there no more holes in this vessell, you might soone stop the leake.</ab>

              deliver six lines of the prologue on stage, before bailiffs appeared to arrest him for
              debt. Although he pocketed 'much mony,' the authorities did not indict him (Vennar,

          <p>On 24 May 1589, <rs ref="eats:151032" type="Person_Male">Francis Langley</rs> acquired by deed the lordship and manor of <rs ref="eats:223902" type="Place_PA_Manor ">Paris Garden</rs>, paying £850 for the property. 
            <rs ref="eats:492442" type="Person_Male">Thomas Cure the Younger</rs> would convey the property and manor house before the feast of the <rs ref="eats:41188" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Nativity of St John the Baptist</rs> 
          that same year. See further the Introduction: History of the Property<!-- #link to Introduction -->.</p>
        <lb/>
          <p>On 1 December 1601 <rs ref="eats:492522" type="Person_Male">Hugh</rs> and his son <rs ref="eats:492583" type="Person_Male">Thomas Browker</rs> assumed the lease of the manor of Paris Garden from Francis and <rs ref="eats:492656" type="Person_Female">Jane 
          Langley</rs>. For a more detailed account of the desperate financial circumstances and context for Langley's sale of the lease, 
          see further Ingram, <title>London Life</title>, pp 250–67. Ingram, p 322, notes that the final step in the transfer of 
            ownership from Langley to Browker concluded on 3 February 1602 (Feet of Fines, CP 25(2)/228/44ELIZIHIL, mb 4; see also 
            Ingram, p 322 n 26). My special thanks to Patrick Gregory, REED Associate Editor and Latinist, for his transcription and translation of this lease.</p>
        <lb/>
          <p>This undated document from the seventeenth century is titled ‘Lands Concealed and to be obteyned of the Kings Ma{ies}tie.’ 
            The lands had formerly belonged to the Knights Templar, but on suppression of the order, the manor was granted to the Knights 
            Hospitaller. In 1536 it was surrendered to the Crown. The date <hi rend="italic">c</hi> March 1606 has been assigned by a much later handwritten 
            note and has been accepted by some others (for example, Herbert Berry, 'The Swan,' (Berry <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, <title>English Professional 
              Theatre</title>, pp 439, 448). However, the <rs ref="eats:226221" type="Place_PA_Settlement">St Saviour's</rs> Token Books list an <rs ref="eats:492955" type="Person_Male">Alexander Welch</rs> living near the <rs ref="eats:227779" type="Place_F_Playhouse">playhouse</rs> for only 
            three years, between 1627–9, so the early dating to 1606 should be questioned. See Ingram and Nelson, <ref
            target="https://tokenbooks.folger.edu"><title>Token Books</title></ref>, the 1627 entry for Alexander Welch. 
            Further, it is known that others were living in the manor house in the period when the <rs ref="eats:227779" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Swan</rs> was occasionally used following the death of 
            Francis Langley. Alexander Walsh (Welch) would therefore seem an unlikely candidate for management of the playhouse in the early 
            seventeenth century. See further the Introduction: History of the Property<!-- #link to Introduction -->.

            Wiggins and Richardson' annotated catalogue <title>British Drama 1533–1642</title>, vols 2–4, serves 
            as authority for the title, authors, troupes, genre and status listed below. Further details of date, 
            plot, roles, staging, sources, performance history, and more for each play are provided –– as far as 
            possible –– in that source, according to a numbering system provided here, by volume. See also Wiggins and Richardson, 'Introduction,' vol 1, for the scope and limitations, content, format and arrangement of the catalogue. 
          </p>
          <p> The number of lost plays listed below reveals how difficult it is to assess any individual company preferences for tragedies and histories over, for example, comedies, in their repertory. 
            The ongoing collaborative work of contributors to the <ref target="https://lostplays.folger.edu/"><title>Lost Plays Database</title></ref> is a further valuable contribution to repertory studies.</p>
