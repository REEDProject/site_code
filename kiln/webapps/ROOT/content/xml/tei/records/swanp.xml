The lord mayor probably now had two theatres to worry
about on Bankside, both the Rose and Francis Langley's new
Swan playhouse in Paris Garden. The mayor had previously
expressed anxiety about Langley's intention to erect his
playhouse in a letter to Lord Burghley on 3 November
1594<!-- #IN link toLA: COL/RMD/PA/01/002, ff 33–3v -->.

<ab>There are four amphitheatres in London of evident beauty,
which acquire their various names from (their) various signs.
In them a different performance is shown daily to the people.
The two more exceptional of these, named the Rose and the Swan
from (their) hanging signs, are situated south of the Thames.
The other two are in the north, outside the city, on the
street which is accessed by the bishop's gate, called
'Bishopsgate' in the vernacular. There is also a fifth but of
a different structure intended for the fighting of animals, in
which many bears, bulls, and dogs of stupendous size are
raised in separate cages and enclosures, (and) are reserved
for the fight, providing the most delightful spectacle for
people. The most outstanding, however, and the largest of all
the theatres is the one whose sign is the swan – in the
vernacular 'the theatre of the swan' – for it seats 3000
people. It is built from heaped flint stone – of which there
is a great abundance in Britain – and is supported by wooden
pillars which by their painted marble colour, can deceive the
most discerning. Since its form seems to express the shadow of
a Roman work, I have made a drawing  above<gap reason="omitted"/>.</ab>

The two playhouses outside the city boundaries north of
the river were the Theatre and the Curtain. The splendour and
generous dimensions of the Swan were later emulated by Philip
Henslowe when his second playhouse, the Hope, was built on
Bankside in 1613 (see Gilbert Katherens' contract with
Henslowe and Jacob Meade for rebuilding the Bear
Garden,<!-- #link to Hovland and MacLean, <title>Bear
Garden/Hope Playhouse</title> -->). A sketch of the Swan's

This order was never carried out and may not have been
related to the performance of <title>The Isle of Dogs</title>
during the same summer as some have assumed; see Ingram,
'Closing of the Theaters,' pp 105–15. Glynne Wickham, while
subscribing to the view that the order should be seen in the
context of the <title>Isle of Dogs</title> production, has
pointed out that the intention of the order was essentially a
restraint of public performances in London for three months
only, rather than outright suppression of all theatres. In
fact, playing resumed at the Curtain and the Rose (but not the
Swan) in October and November 1597. As he notes, the
Chamberlain's and Admiral's Men were preparing for
performances at Court during the Christmas season and both
enjoyed the patronage of members of the privy council, so
rehearsing for a royal audience would have facilitated their
return to those two public stages in the autumn. See further
'The Privy Council Order of 1597 for the Destruction of all
London's Theatres,' <title>The Elizabethan Theatre: Papers
given at the International Conference on Elizabethan Theatre
held at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, in July
1968</title>, David Galloway (ed) (Toronto, 1969), 21–44.

Richard Topcliffe (1531–1604) was employed by the
government to interrogate suspects and was known as a cruel
torturer; see William Richardson, 'Topcliffe, Richard
(1531–1604), interrogator and torturer,' <title>ODNB</title>,
accessed 30 October 2024. Thomas Fowler and Richard Skevington
are named with other JPs of Middlesex in the 28 July 1597
privy council order attempting to suppress playhouses in the
London area; see<!-- #link to RSPCL7 -->. 'docto<ex>u</ex>r
ffletcher' was Giles Fletcher (1546–1611), appointed
remembrancer of the city of London in 1586; see further Lucy
Munro, 'Fletcher, Giles, the elder (bap. 1546, d. 1611),
diplomat and author,' <title>ODNB</title>, accessed 30 October

common serjeant of the city of London.

Nash, the playwright, beat a hasty retreat to Great Yarmouth
where he remained for some months, not without loss of income
and reputation. His 1599 pamphlet, <title>Nashes Lenten
Stuffe</title>, reflects on the experience: 'THe straunge
turning of the Ile of Dogs fro<ex>m</ex> a commedie to a tragedie
two summers past, with the troublesome stir which hapned
aboute it, is a generall rumour that hath filled all England,
and such a heavie crosse laide vpon me, as had well neere
confounded mee: I meane, not so much in that it sequestred me
from the woonted meanes of my maintenance, which is as great a
maime to any mans happinesse, as can bee feared from the hands
of miserie, or the deepe pit of dispaire wherinto I was falne,
beyond my greatest friendes reach to recouer mee: but that, in
my exile and irkesome discontented abandonment, the silliest
millers thombe, or contemptible stickle-banck of my enemies,
is as busie nibbling about my fame, as if I were a deade man
throwne amongest them to feede vpon<gap reason="omitted"/>. That infortunate
imperfit Embrion of my idle houres the Ile of Dogs before
mencioned, breeding vnto me such bitter throwes in the teaming
as it did, and the tempestes that arose at his birth, so
astonishing outrageous and violent as if my braine had bene
conceiued of another Hercules, I was so terrifyed with my owne
encrease (like a woman long trauailing to bee deliuered of a
monster) that it was no sooner borne but I was glad to run
from it. Too inconsiderate headlong rashnesse this may be
censured in me, in beeing thus prodigall in advantaging my
aduersaries, but my case is no smoothered secret, and with
light cost of rough cast rethorieke it may be tollerablely
playstered ouer, if vnder the pardon and priuiledge of
incensed higher powers it were lawfully indulgenst me freely
to aduocate my owne astrology. Sufficeth what they in their
graue wisdoomes shall proscribe, I in no sorte will seeke to
acquite, nor presumptuously attempte to dispute against the
equity of their iudgementes, but, humble and prostrate appeale
to their mercies. Avoide or giue grounde I did, scriptum est,
I will not goe from it, and post varios casus, variable Knight

Yarmouth in Norfolke I ariued in the latter ende of Autumne'

The third company that had drawn the ire of the privy
council is not identified here but this letter provides
evidence that attempts to limit the number of companies and
playhouses in the London area continued to be unsuccessful.
The Lord Admiral's Men remained based at the Rose until 1600
when the Fortune playhouse opened in Clerkenwell north of the
city wall.

In 1589 Francis Langley had acquired the lordship of the manor
of Paris Garden, west of Bankside in the parish of St Saviour,
Southwark. By 1595 he had opened a second playhouse there, the
Swan, which must have increased the traffic of playgoers
across the Thames to the area (for further details and
illustrations, see the 'Introduction,' <!-- #add link -->).
Jacob Meade (1557-1624) was a waterman, resident in the Clink
liberty and Henslowe's partner in the later Hope/Bear Garden
enterprise. It seems possible from this entry in the vestry
minutes that he may have had an association with Henslowe for
the Rose as well as the Bear Garden by 1598, around the time
when he was appointed keeper of the Royal Game of Bears,
Bulls, and Mastiff Dogs (see further Warner,
<title>Catalogue</title>, p 234). Meade first appears in 1597
as a resident of Rose Alley in the Clink in the St Saviour
Token Books<!-- # insert link to http://tokenbooks.folger.edu/s
earch/snapshot.php?booknumber=246&amp;entrynumber=31906 -->. The
playhouses concerned here and below are Langley's Swan in
Paris Garden manor and Henslowe's Rose in the Clink liberty,
both within the parish boundaries of St Saviour's.

The 'diuers houses' on Bankside at this time included the
Rose and the Swan as well as the Globe, now the recently
opened base for the lord chamberlain's men. Whether this order
had a direct impact on the type of entertainment offered
henceforth at the Swan is an open question but Henslowe's Rose
continued its operation for at least three more years after
the lord admiral's men moved north of the river to the Fortune
playhouse. See 'History of the Playhouse'<!-- # insert cross-

Those present at this meeting of the privy council on 15
May are listed in the left margin at the top of the page as
follows: Sir Thomas Egerton (1540-1617), lord keeper of the
Great Seal, 1596-1617; Thomas Sackville (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1536-1608),
first Baron Buckhurst, lord treasurer,1599-1608; Charles

Robert Cecil (1563-1612), secretary of state, 1596-1612.</p>

<p>
A letter on 12 May 1600 from Rowland Whyte to Sir Robert
Sidney mentions that the queen intended that same day to see a
Frenchman (presumably the same Peter Bromvill) do 'feates upon
a rope' in the Conduit Court. See Historical Manuscripts
Commission, <title>Report on the Manuscripts of Lord De L'Isle
&amp; Dudley preserved at Penshurst Place</title>, C.L. Kingsford
(ed), vol 2 (London, 1934), 461. Chambers also notes in his
Court Calendar that 12 May featured 'activities' by Peter
Bromvill (<title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 4, p 112 and n
17). Peter Bromvill had 'danced upon the rope' before the
queen. Claire McManus, in 'Women investors and gendered
performance at the second Fortune playhouse (2)' for the
Shakespeare Association of America meeting (Portland, 2024),
notes 'a breathtaking L.333, 6s, 8d. Scots' for Bromville's
performance before King James VI and Queen Anna in August 1600
at Falkland Palace (citing <title>The Autobiography and Diary
of Mr James Melvill</title>, Robert Pitcairn (ed) (Woodrow
Society, 1842), vol 2, 487).

John Chamberlain's amusing account of events at the Swan
in a letter to Dudley Carleton on 19 November (TNA: SP12/285)
reveals that Vennar was unable to pull off this ambitious one-
day production - and indeed probably never intended to,
despite the broadside promotion of its plot. However, the play
was finally staged in 1615 at another theatre, with William
Fennor among the actors. John Taylor, <title>A Cast over the
Water</title> (1615), sig B5v, includes Fennor's poorly
received performance in a mocking reference to the play:
'Indeed, thou set'st the people in a rage<pb/> In playing Englands
Ioy, that euery Man<pb/> Did iudge it worse then that was done at
Swan.<pb/> I neuer saw poore fellow so behist,<pb/> T'applaud thee,
few or none lent halfe a fist:' Taylor (sig C3) goes on to
mention Fennor's swindling of 'poore old Vennor, that plaine
dealing man,<pb/> Who acted Englands Ioy first at the Swan,'
perhaps a tongue in cheek salute to Vennor's own dubious
'plain dealing.'</p>

<p>
There is also an undated poem by 'R.V.' (Richard Vennar)
called <title>Englands Ioy</title> (<title>STC</title>:
24636.3), celebrating the same victory against the Irish
rebels led by Tyrone and their Spanish allies under Don Juan
de Aguila. Baron Mountjoy's victory at Kensale took place on
24 December 1601, so the poem may have been published around
the same time that Vennar announced his play.

Some years later Joseph Swetnam, <title>The Schoole of the
Noble and Worthy Science of Defence</title> (2nd ed, 1617),
<title>STC</title>: 23543, sigs C3v–C4, recalled this
incident: 'And now (for examples sake) I thinke it not amisse
to renew your remembrance with the death of some few of the
Noble Science, because I haue knowne their ends; and first, to
beginne with that one of maister Turner, which should be the
last, he did not so speedily kill Iohn Dun, with a thrust in
the eie, but he was as soone murthered afterwards, with a
shotte of a Pistoll; for neither of them, after they had their
deaths wound, spake one word; loe by this you may see, that
some hawkes are but a flight, and horses are killed with a
tournie, and a man is but a shotte; but now, by reason that
Maister Turner, by his vnluckie hand, thrust out two or three
eies, and because none others are knowne to doe the like, it
hath therefore bred an admiration in the ignorant and vulgare
sort, insomuch, that generally they doe applaude him with this
commendation, saying that hee hath not left the like behinde
him, nor neuer will be the like againe: But this is a great
errour in thinking so, and farre deceiued are they; for I well
know Maister Turner by familair acquaintance, and therefore
(to speake the right) he was a worthy fellow and deserued
well, but yet I know many which can goe neare the eie as euer
he could doe, if they so listed, as in this booke you shall
see many false thrusts at seuerall weapons which may<pb/>endanger
any mans eies, if those which learne them doe carry enuious
mindes, or if they were desirous to worke a man such a
mischiefe, but God forbid that any man should be so ill
minded, I will not say, but that by chaunce such a thing may
be done, and so it may bee that Maister Turner did it more by
chance, without any intention<gap reason="omitted"/>'</p>

Jay P. Anglin, 'The Schools of Defense in Elizabethan London,'
<title>Renaissance Quarterly</title> 37.3 (1984), 406, notes
that John Turner was shot dead on 11 May 1612 by Robert
Carlysle, one of two assassins hired by Robert Crichton,
eighth Lord Crichton of Sanquhar (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1568–1612).
Crichton had lost an eye in a fencing match with Turner in
1604 but did not seek revenge until 1612. He and both
assassins were subsequently hanged (see M.J. Bowman,
'Crichton, Robert, eighth Lord Crichton of Sanquhar (c.
1568–1612), nobleman and murderer,' <title>ODNB</title>,
accessed 27 October 2024).

<ab><gap reason="omitted"/>I saw a <pb/> daily offring to the God of pleasure, resident at
the Globe on the Banke-side, of much more then would have
supplyed my then want; I noted euery mans hand ready to feed
the luxury of his eye, that puld downe his hat to stop the
sight of his charity, wherefore I concluded to make a friend
of Mammon, and to giue them sound for words, both being but
aire, for which they should giue double payment, to the intent
onely, men of ability might make the purchase without
repentance, and my selfe obserue that wise rule of Phylosophy;
Non fiat per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora:<note type="foot">Non …

beginning with Chambers, the Harpe of war, and ending with
Hounds, <pb/> the cry of peace, of which I was doubly prouided,
for Fox and Hare.</ab>

<ab>The report of Gentlemen and Gentlewomens actions, being indeed
the flagge to our Theater, was not meerely falcification, for
I had diuers Chorus to bee spoken by men of good birth,
Schollers by profession; protesting that the businesse was
meerely abused, by the comming of some Beagles vpon mee, that
were none of the intended Kennell, I meane Baylifes, who
seizing mee before the first entrance, spoke an Epilogue
instead of a Prologue, this changed the play into the hunting
of the Fox; which, that the world may know for a verity, I
heere promise the next Tearme, with the true history of my <pb/>
life, to bee publiquely presented, to insert in place of
Musicke, for the actes, all those intendments prepared for
that daies entertainement: Which, seeing it must rest in your
beliefes till then, I will bee content so long to weare your
Apellation, preferring onely in this Imputation, so farre the
part of an Apologist, that drawing the accident it selfe,
without defence, into iudicious question, this Scoggins Crow,
that hath filled so many mouths will proue but a Rooke. For
suppose that the play was hist, was I the first Poet made my
Clients penitents, let the burning pestle bee heard in my
cause, which rang so dismally in your eares, and yet the
Writer in state of Grace. <pb/></ab>

<ab>The difference was, I presented you with a Dumbe Show, and the
Players say, that is alwaies as good as a bad act, neither
could the cost bee great, that for one twelue pence, afforded
mirth for a Twelue-month after: At the highest rate, you lent
mee but an after-noones hearing, the expectation being worth
the money: since Phylosophers say, that the sweetnesse of hope
is beyond the enjoying, and in this sense, I bettered that
daies trauell, the errour being your owne, that being ignorant
of a Logitian, stile mee an Impostor, from which I am so
farre, that the Law shall speake for mee, whch presupposeth
euery man good, till hee bee conuicted bad; And I presume it
came not within the <pb/> compasse of an inditement: The
conclusion is this, I had too many Patrons for so slender a
worke, and for that fault, this Apologie is my sufficient
answere. Neither is it strange to haue so much mony for six
verses, since Bonum quo communius eo melius<note type="foot">Bonum …

Dona Hollandia finds the ideal location for her brothel
'out of the Citie, yet in the view of the Citie, only divided
by a delicate River' (sig F1), with a tradition of 'open
Hospitality' and nearby playhouses that would help to draw
customers – the Globe or 'Continent of the World'; the Hope,
home to gladiators and wild beasts, and the Swan, now fallen
into decay.

Richard Vennar (1564–1615) was admitted to Lincoln's Inn
on 10 June 1581 and resided there for much of his turbulent
career. See further Berry, 'Richard Vennar, England's Joy,' pp
240–65; Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 3, pp
500–3; and Vennar's own account of the much-mocked and
abortive performance at the Swan in <title>An Apology</title>,
published in 1614 and transcribed in this edition<!-- #link to
SWVEAA -->.</p>

<p>
In his broadside, <title>The Plot of the Play Called
'England's Joy'</title> (1602)<!-- #link to SWPPEJ -->, Vennar
announced its performance at the Swan on 6 November 1602.
According to Vennar's account years later in 1614, he was only
able to deliver six lines of the prologue on stage, before
bailiffs appeared to arrest him for debt. Although he pocketed
'much mony,' the authorities did not indict him (Vennar,
<title>Apology</title>, p 27). The play was finally mounted by
William Fennor in the spring of 1615, another performance
mocked by John Taylor in <title>A Cast Over Water</title>
(1615)<!-- #link to SWJTCW -->.

The venue on Bankside is known to have been the Swan
Playhouse in Paris Garden from John Chamberlain's letter to
Dudley Carleton on 11 February (TNA: SP12/287). John Turner
and John Dun were famous master fencers of the period.

Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, p 413,
notes that this entry is 'of so small an amount that it
probably only covered a fraction of a year, and I think the
inference is that the Swan was disused on the opening of the
Hope in 1614.'
