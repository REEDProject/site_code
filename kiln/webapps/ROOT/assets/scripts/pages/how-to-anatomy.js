But, if you come across a date with a diagonal in it, such as 1452/3, this means that the date of the record falls between 1 January 1453 and 24 March 1453. The weird description comes about because the scribe would have thought of that period as falling in 1452, whereas since 1752 (England) and 1600 (Scotland), we have thought of the new year as beginning on 1 January not 25 March, and so we would regard that as coming from 1453.',
