        ABOUT

This Django app is responsible for pulling from the remote origin for
the REED site_code repository on the machine running Django. It uses
GitPython to perform the operations, using credentials supplied by the
user.


        INSTALLATION

Requires the GitPython library (pip install gitpython).

Requires the Django setting GIT_REPOSITORY_PATH to be set to the root
of the Git repository to be updated.


        POTENTIAL ISSUES

The operation modifies the Git configuration file temporarily in order
to add the credentials to the remote URL.

The GitPython documentation say that the library is "not suited for
long-running processes as it tends to leak system resources". It seems
unlikely that the very limited use of the library, that will not be
frequently invoked, will cause any perceptible issues, but it is
possible.
