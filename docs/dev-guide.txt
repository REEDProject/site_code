Guide for Developers of REED Online
===================================

Necessary Skills and Technologies
---------------------------------

* XSLT (transformations of TEI and EATSML into HTML; this is the
majority of the code for the site)
* Python 3 (processing of Word files into TEI, processing of GeoJSON
into XML; the EATS application)
* Apache Cocoon and Apache Solr (as bundled in Kiln; mostly what is
required is familiarity with Cocoon's processing model and how to
create/modify pipelines, and how to configure Solr for new search
scenarios)
* Django (used in EATS, the processing of Word and GeoJSON data, and
updating the Git repository on servers)
* Apache Tomcat, Apache HTTPD (used to serve Kiln and Django
respectively, with Kiln proxied through HTTPD; minor customisation
here may be required)


Repository
----------

All of the project-specific code for REED Online is stored in the
site_code repository at https://vc.library.utoronto.ca/reed/site_code.git


Site Architecture
-----------------

The website has a number of components (hierarchy represents
server/serves relationship):

Apache HTTPD
   - Django (for administrators only)
        - EATS
        - Word to TEI converter
        - GeoJSON converter
        - Server updater
   - Proxy to Apache Tomcat
        - Kiln (Cocoon, Solr)


External Documentation
----------------------

Kiln's documentation is at https://kiln.readthedocs.io, which also
links to the Apache Cocoon documentation.

EATS's documentation is at https://eats.readthedocs.io/.


Website Overview
----------------

The public part of the website is built in Kiln from three data sets:

* the REED records and associated materials in TEI XML;
* the EATS entity data in EATSML XML; and
* GIS data in GeoJSON.

All three are (in those forms) stored in the Git site_code repository,
with the EATS and GIS data being downloaded and converted from their
respective sources via the links in the Kiln admin (/admin/).

In order to understand what steps Kiln is following to produce a given
page, use the introspection tools at /admin/introspection/.
